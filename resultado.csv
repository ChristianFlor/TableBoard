ABDUL-FATAHI ABDULAI (2019) - UNIVERSITY KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER AND INNOVATION PERFORMANCE IN FIRMS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The survey questionnaire was designed to capture information on how ffrms  source new knowledge from universities and its likely impact on levels of inno�vative activity. The sample of ffrms was drawn from two separate databases in  Ghana. One was obtained from the National Board for Small Scale Industries  (NBSSI) and the other from the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI); while the  former is a Ghana government agent, the latter is a voluntary association of  industries in Ghana; both include SMEs and large ffrms in Ghana across all  sectors. In each database, ffrms, as our statistical units of analysis for the study,  were grouped in strata representing primary, secondary and service sectors for  stratiffed simple random sampling as categories of interest to the study. Another  sub-category of ffrms that were of interest to the study was size, which was  considered in terms of number of employees a ffrm had at the time of the survey.
Both categories of interest were then included as dummy variables in partial least  squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) model with sub-levels (entered  as ‘1’, ‘2’, etc.) to be controlled for to improve the interpretation of the ffndings.

";;;;;;;;;;;;"Deffnitions of innovation are often structured to reffect current global develop�ments and changes of the markets; for instance, the Chain-Link model (OECD,  2005a), the triple helix framework (Etzkowitz, 2003) and open innovation models  arguably provide a clearer understanding of the concept of innovation (Ches�brough, 2006; Bradley et al., 2013).
For the purpose of this study, innovation is interpreted as incremental changes  and activities of a ffrm, which holistically leads to the introduction of a novel or  improved product, service or process. Change is considered to be a key facet of  innovation (Samson et al., 2017) Arguably, deffnitions of innovation have ste�reotypically put less emphasis on the soft and less tangible elements of ffrm’s  business operations, focusing largely on technology-based innovation (OECD,  2005a). Murphy et al. (2016) provide a critique of such traditional innovation  metrics who consider that most innovation policies concentrate on technological  innovation at the expense of, for example, hidden innovation.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;There are many deffnitions for social capital. Coleman (1988) believes that social  capital exists in the ‘relations among persons’. The notion of location of  social capital employed by Conway and Steward (2009) reveals their view that  social capital is not owned by any individual or group but exists in their rela�tionships with others. This, they say, is because if an individual were to withdraw  from a relationship, the social capital is likely to cease to exist. However, Huggins  and Johnston (2010) and García-Villaverdea et al. (2018) argue that social capital  can be held by an individual. This interpretation of social capital may create a  dilemma in terms of its questioning of whether social capital is an individual and/  or a group construct. Huggins and Johnston (2010) question whether individuals  seek social capital for personal gain or for an organisational-based motive;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Further to this, within the framework of this network of  knowledge generation, universities remain a traditional core knowledge generation  actor, which, in turn provides knowledge for ffrms creating regional and national  growth and development ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Universities are considered important elements of the complex network of  external knowledge generation and are key institutions inffuencing the internal  dynamics of ffrms as learning organisations (Lam, 2000; Abreu et al., 2009).
Research indicates that one of the most prominent ways universities inffuence  innovation in ffrms is through collaboration as depicted in Fig. 2, often with  legally binding agreements (Lam, 1997; Banal-Estanol et al., 2011).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;From the analysis of the results, it is evident that collaboration between Ghanaian  universities and industry in Ghana is positive and directly related to ffrms’ inno�vation performance.;;"Finally, a number of limitations to this study should be recognised. Government  agents and other development stakeholders were not recruited for data collection.
Further, the data collection framework did not include ffrms from the informal  sector of the economy, and consequently the interpretation may not be exhaustive  enough for policy-making. ";;" Future research  could focus on the impact of current intellectual property legislation, policies and  practices on knowledge transfer and innovation performance of ffrms in Ghana.
Other possibilities for future research include integrating the informal/unofffcial  business sector into the study sample.

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This paper discusses the relationship between internationalisation,   mobility, quality and equality in the context of recent developments in research   policy in the European Research Area (ERA). ;;;;;;;;;;;" It suggests that, notwithstanding these   initiatives, 'most researchers in Europe still find their career opportunities curtailed   by legal and practical barriers hampering their mobility' (2007, p. 7). 
Our research would question the inference of causation in this statemen";;;;;;;Mobility between institutions , although often requiring physical relocation,   must also be distinguished from forms of international mobility although the two   are connected;;". One of these concerns the traditional   distinction between permanent forms of 'migration' and more temporary forms of   'mobility' (2002). The general consensus, at least among theorists of highly skilled   migration, would seem to be that this distinction now holds little validity and may   indeed constrain our understanding (Ackers and Gill 2008; Rannveig et al. 2007)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;n such situations, attempting to achieve a level of mobility in order to access the   'social capital' or 'prestige' that many researchers feel is necessary, or simply to   gain broader 'international' experience associated with living in another country,   may prove detrimental to research 'success' and research quality;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;To the extent that the process of   knowledge transfer between industry and academia is sub-optimal (and this varies   enormously between disciplines and countries), this reflects a quite specific range of   factors, mainly connected to differential pay and conditions and the preservation of   marked diversity in career progression systems;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Forced Mobility : the Implications of Contractual Insecurity and Low Pay   Although our studies have identified individuals who engage in calculated, repeated,   international mobility in order to invest in their human and social capital through   'centre-hopping', these cases are unusual and typically involve people who hav;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"'Mobility has to take very different forms. It has to be very variable; it has to   be able to be adapted to different types of careers, different disciplines and   different types of family and lifestyles because you may have a family so I   think mobility has to adapt to that diversity. 
I feel that pressure is coming [to enforce mobility] I can feel it here at the   Institute. Because we have post docs for 3 years and then after that their post   doc can be renewed but there's a norm in my institute, now, when they get to   the end of 3 years they've got to go abroad, they've got to go somewhere else. 
Mobility can be very good but in other cases you want somebody to stay and   to do research with you for 6 years, not only for 3 because people begin to get   integrated at the end of 2 years so if you tell them to go away after 3 years,   well maybe that's not always very good for their career or even for the   institute. I get the feeling that mobility is becoming a norm that has to be   enforced whatever the situation and I don't think that's good. ";;s. This approach enables   researchers to remain deeply engaged with their professional communities at home   and also with their personal and family lives. In most cases, researchers augment the   physical dimension of mobility with other forms of 'virtual' communication   enabling networks to evolve and deepen. Extricating researchers from this home   context is not necessarily productive. Having said that, some of our respondents   clearly enjoyed and benefited very much from living and working abroad. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Alessandro Muscio (2021) - Universities-and-startup-creation-by-PhD-graduates-the-role;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; The empirical exercise is based on questionnaire sur�vey data of 5266 Ph.D. students in Italian universities in all subject areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Student entrepreneurship · Entrepreneurial university · Start-up · Ph.D. · Firm   creation · Academic training;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Academic entrepreneurship is a complex phenomenon that involves several stakeholders,   ranging from faculty staf to post-doctoral fellows and students, who choose to become   entrepreneurs. Among others, entrepreneurial activities by Ph.D. students, though largely   neglected in prior literature, deserve special attention for several reasons. First, Ph.D. stu�dents may be better placed than academic staf to overcome the obstacles to the creation   of new ventures. Unlike academic staf, as stressed by Colombo and Piva (2012), students   do not need a ‘genetic mutation’ to become entrepreneurs and are often well positioned   in gaining access to business competences. Second, entrepreneurship can be a viable job   option for Ph.D. graduates, who seek to exploit the knowledge and skills learned through   the training. Third, unlike undergraduate students, Ph.D. students have direct access to   knowledge-intensive business ideas, which they develop through their training period and   can exploit for startup.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This paper investigates how the characteristics of university laboratories infuence the pro�pensity of Ph.D. students to entrepreneurship, and thus, contribute to the transfer of aca�demic knowledge to society. ;;;;;;;;;;;"Hypothesis 2: The business experience of the lab positively moderates the impact of the   lab scientifc capital on Ph.D. students’ startup activity.
";;;;;;;" Third, students with broader network can grow   more open-minded and develop broader research and occupational perspectives (Altbach   and Knight 2007), fostering their progression along the entrepreneurial ladder (Felicio   et al. 2015; Horta 2010; Minola et al. 2016). Fourth, social capital contributes to the qual�ity of scientifc research, which can be then translated into a greater chance of Ph.D. entre�preneurship through the aforementioned positive efects of scientifc capital";;;;;;;;;"Startup by Ph.D. students (Ph.D. entrepreneurship, hereafter) is peculiar in that it is   situated at the intersection of the three academic missions: teaching, research and academic   engagement. That is, Ph.D. entrepreneurs transfer the result of academic research, devel�oped through graduate education, to the society. Thus, it is of interest for the purpose of   science and technology (S&T) policies to better understand what factors support Ph.D. 
entrepreneurship and under what circumstances students choose to establish new ventures. 
Nonetheless, prior research is scarce.
";;"The frst factor infuencing Ph.D. students’ choice to become entrepreneurs is the business   experience they obtain through working in the lab. How students are exposed to entrepre�neurship during their training period is critical (Hayter et al. 2017). While entrepreneurship   programmes can nurture and stimulate startup activities (Maresch et al. 2016; Muscio and   Ramaciotti 2019), the literature emphasises that access to relevant business networks and   learning-by-doing through research projects are far more efective than simply attending   dedicated courses (Rasmussen and Sorheim 2006).
Business experience can stem from various sources, such as collaboration with industry,   contract research, consultancy work, and engagement in industry-oriented research pro�jects.";;"The excellence of research environment is also infuenced by   the availability of physical and fnancial resources, which determine how certain research   tasks can be performed, the capacity to purchase equipment and material, and opportuni�ties of conference participation and publication. Other factors embedded in scientifc capi�tal are the time devoted to research by students and their autonomy in research activities. 
In some contexts, Ph.D. students can be occupied with teaching and other activities, which   can hinder scientifc performance";;;;;;;;"The third university-level factor that can infuence Ph.D. students’ choice to become entre�preneurs is the lab social capital. Social capital is here intended as the outward orientation   of a lab, accounting for its engagement in collaboration with external research teams and in   external experiences. Students can reap the benefts that derive from social capital via the   participation in collaborative research projects, visits to diferent research contexts, inter�national conferences, exposure to real-world business problems, and so forth.
The social capital of a lab can facilitate Ph.D. entrepreneurship for a few reasons. First,   academic institutions with broader networks tend to be situated closer to the boundaries of   scientifc discoveries (Knight 2015), which gives students greater access to wide audience.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In academic entrepreneurship by students, they rely on the lab and on their supervi�sors for at least three important resources: (1) the scientifc capital and resources, which   students can directly or indirectly transfer to their business; (2) the social capital of the   research team, which opens up access to external national or international network, expos�ing their ideas to a broader audience; and (3) the entrepreneurial and business experience,   which allows students to obtain business contacts and test the validity of their idea for   practical purposes.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The second university-level factor that can infuence Ph.D. students’ choice is the scientifc   capital of the lab embodied in several factors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Second, social capital is known as one of the preconditions   for entrepreneurship ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"of 67 Italian universities, nine Italian Research Institutions, one Polyclinic and the Ital�ian Ministry of Education and Research (MIUR). 9,062 completed questionnaires were   returned. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate the Ph.D. programme and asked stu�dents general questions about their training period, their level of satisfaction with the Ph.D. 
programme, their occupational status and entrepreneurial activities.
The data show that at the time of the survey 68% of 9,062 respondents completed their   Ph.D. studies and 72% were employed. 6.5% of respondents had started a business, 87% of   which were still active at the time of the survey.
The sample was reduced to 5266 observations, excluding the responses of those students   that had not yet graduated at the time of the survey and those that did not answer relevant   questions. Figure 1 presents the career outcomes of graduates. Overall, a relatively high   proportion (6.3%) of the graduates had startup experience. For the rest, 64% of the gradu�ates are employed in academia, 20% employed outside of academia, and 10% unemployed.
Among those who had startup experience, 56% of the businesses are associated with   university technologies and know-how (e.g., university spin-of), whereas 44% are not   related (e.g., corporate spin-of). Furthermore, among the students who engaged in univer�sity-related startups, 73% maintain employment at the university (e.g., postdoc), whereas   27% did not. This suggests that Ph.D. entrepreneurs often secure an income source on top   of their startup businesses. We also break down subject areas into natural sciences and   engineering (Fig. 1b) and social sciences and humanities (Fig. 1c).";;;;;;"In order to investigate our research hypotheses, we created two variables concerning   Ph.D. student’s engagement in startup activities and other career choices. The frst is   a dichotomous variable coded 1 if a student started or was involved in the establish�ment of a startup and 0 otherwise (startup). The second variable distinguishes all career   options: (1) startup, (2) academic employment, (3) non-academic employment, and (4)   being unemployed. We further break down the types of startup: (1a) university-related   startups with academic employment, (1b) university-related startups without academic   employment, and (1c) university-unrelated startups, because we expect that they should   be explained by diferent conditions. Taken all together, we prepared a categorical vari�able with six career options (career option).

The Cronbach’s alpha is 0.728 and 0.828 respectively. We also validated the distinction of   these two dimensions of lab capitals by a confrmatory factor analysis ";;;;;;First, we fnd that   6.7% of the Ph.D. graduates engage in startup activities, and thus, Ph.D. training seems to   contribute to knowledge transfer through entrepreneurship. Second, Ph.D. entrepreneurship   is driven by business experience, in the forms of industry collaboration and industrially   applicable research projects, during their training period. Third, the lab scientifc capital is   negatively associated with Ph.D. entrepreneurship, suggesting a confict between scientifc   excellence and entrepreneurship, but this efect is mitigated if students acquire business   experience. Fourth, the lab social capital increases the chance of startup when students   have business experience.;;Despite relevant theoretical and policy implications, this study faces some important limitations,   the most important being the cross-sectional nature of the database, which reduces the ability to   check any cause-efect implication between lab environment and Ph.D. entrepreneurship. Second,   this study does not consider the long-term outcome of Ph.D. entrepreneurship (e.g., growth, eco�nomic returns), which should be evaluated to design policies. Third, the sample specifcity limits   the generalisability of our fndings. The operation of Ph.D. training as well as career systems difer   between countries, which should infuence the rationale behind students’ career decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Its popularity is due to readily available  software, such as SmartPicker (Nemery et al., 2012) and Visual PROMETHEE (Ishizaka et al.,  2018) and D-Sight (Hayez et al., 2012), which can be used easily. In PROMETHEE,  normalisation is not needed, which means that scores on each criterion can be given in their  natural units. This property has the advantage of avoiding any scaling effect problem, which  indicates that a ranking is dependent on the selected normalisation method (Ishizaka and  Nemery, 2011; Tofallis, 2008). The only inputs the decision-maker requires are the weighting of  the criteria and the preference function, which are generally defined by an indifference and  preference threshold.
";;;;;;;The purpose of this study is to examine the portfolio of knowledge transfer (KT) activities in 162 UK  higher education institutions. In doing so, this study creates an index and ranking, but more importantly, it  identifies specific groupings or strategic profiles of universities defined by different combinations and strengths of  the individual KT activities from which the overall rankings are derived. ;;;;;;;;;;;"Using the existing literature, which often uses basic, dichotomous  relationships in its analysis, leads to the following four broader, research questions:  Based on the work of Abreu et al. (2016) related to the relationship between KT and their  other two missions of research and teaching: How do universities valorise university  knowledge assets in terms of the most beneficial KT activities? (RQ1)  Based on the work of Perkmann et al. (2013) related to research commercialisation and  academic engagement: Which university models/archetypes can be identified and classified  in terms of these KT activities? (RQ2).
Based on the work of Hewitt-Dundas (2012) related to high research-intensive university  activities: What are the most relevant KT activities (both singular and in combination) that  universities are using? (RQ3)  Based on the work of Morgan (2002) related to outreach and research-intensive  dichotomies: What are the relationships between specific university models/archetypes and  university regional economic development policy? (RQ4)";;;;;;;Second, universities differ in their backgrounds with respect to scientific disciplines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"KT activities can be  categorised into research commercialisation and academic engagement (Perkmann et al.,  2013). Research commercialisation refers to activities such as spin-outs, patenting and  licensing activities to commercialise universities’ intellectual properties. While researchers  have devoted substantial attention to these activities (Czarnitzki et al., 2009; Fini et al., 2011;  Magerman et al., 2015), evidence suggests they account for only a relatively small proportion  of all KT activities pursued by universities (Schartinger et al., 2001; HEFCE, 2017).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The portfolio of KT activities pursued by universities is expected to vary for several reasons.
First, universities have different objectives and strategic focus ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"To develop this more nuanced understanding of the KT activities universities pursue, this  study simultaneously analyses the size, scope and focus of universities’ KT portfolios using a  IJEBR  26,6  1390
novel methodological approach based on the Preference Ranking Organization Method for the  Enrichment of Evaluations (PROMETHEE). Using multiple criteria, PROMETHEE allows us  to rank universities according to their portfolios of KT activities whilst simultaneously  identifying and illustrating groups of universities sharing similar KT portfolios. In other words,  using PROMETHEE can uncover the different types or groups of universities based on their  overall KT activities.
";;;;;;"Nine variables are used, capturing various aspects of  universities commercial/income generating KT activities discussed in the literature, as follows:  (1) Attendees at Chargeable Events  (2) Income from Continuous Professional Development  (3) Income from Shares sold in Spin-outs  (4) Income from Regeneration and Development Programmes  (5) Income from Consultancy  IJEBR  26,6  1396
(6) Intellectual Property (IP) Income  (7) Income from Collaborative Research  (8) Income from Contract Research  (9) Income from Facilities and Equipment Related Services  These variables represent only a sub-set of the potential KT and related activities of  universities, and there are limitations to how well they capture the diversity of KT activities at  universities";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Findings show that universities differ substantially in their portfolios of KT activities. By using  PROMETHEE, a new ranking of universities is generated, based on their KT portfolio. This paper also  identifies four distinct types or groups of universities based on the diversity and intensity of their KT activities:  Ambidextrous, broad, focused and indifferent.
";;6.4 Limitations of the study and future research  This research has a number of limitations. First, this study is based on one year of data, and a  more longitudinal approach would be valuable, as Cesaroni and Piccaluga (2016) have  demonstrated in the Italian context. Second, this study is within the UK context only, and  research into a range of international contexts would also help develop this area. Third, whilst  the paper has been able to map the KT activities universities focused on, the individual-level  university reasons that might explain these results have not been analysed, allowing rich  opportunities for understanding underlying strategies in future research. Fourth, the insights  from the data are based on a cross-sectional analysis of those universities which currently  generate income from KT;;"This means, therefore, that this approach is notable to evaluate  longitudinal transitional processes towards more entrepreneurial universities, particularly in  cases where there is no substantial income from the analysed activities. Nor has a detailed  evaluation of the university’s regional economic context been undertaken. More in-depth  analysis of the factors underlying universities’ strategic choices and their regional contexts  would therefore seem to be the most fruitful areas for future research.

It is proposed that meta-rules can help   resolve tensions arising from conficting priorities between academics, knowledge transfer   ofces and industry and help facilitate strategic alignment of processes and policies within   and between organisation;;;;;;;;;;;" It is proposed that these properties can help resolve tensions arising   from conficting priorities between academics, knowledge transfer ofces and industry and   help resolve, inconsistent application of policies within and between organisations.
This research makes a number of key contributions. First it contributes to the growing   debate on the strategic challenges of managing knowledge transfer and presents meta-rules   as a practical solution to facilitate strategy alignment of internal and external stakeholder   tensions. Second, meta-rules has previously only been applied a computer intelligence   context. However, this research proves the efcacy of meta-rules in a university–industry   knowledge transfer context. Third, this research extends organisational learning literature   by illustrating the applicability of meta-rules to aid organisations to learn through embed�ding experience and multi-level alignment into their processes. ";;;;;;; Meta-rules   are defned as ‘rules about rules’ and ‘information about information’ (Davis 1980), apply�ing to the ‘epistemic’ rather than the ‘object’ level. They can help clarify the order of appli�cation of existing, codifed rules within organisations (Dubois et al. 2011) to help organisa�tional decision making;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"For the purposes of our study, universities are considered to be in two categories: research�intensive and applied (O’Kane et  al. 2015), with the assumption that difering strategic   priorities exist for each (Guerrero et al. 2015; Siegel and Wright 2015). Universities must   set an appropriate high-level knowledge transfer strategy and ensure that it aligns with their   own research-intensive or more applied mission, values and goals (Siegel and Wright 2015;   Andrews 1987). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Originating in the computer intelligence feld, the application of meta-rules in the man�agement feld is limited. They have been applied in complex adaptive systems, in the study   of multi-level control parameters for entrepreneurial activity (Fuller et al. 2004) and as a   way to understand and to derive unambiguous strategies (Davies et al. 2006). According   to Davis (1980), meta-rules focus on a ‘discriminant dimension’ which preserve the object   being studied, allowing them to operate in a ‘simplistic (or degraded) mode’. Furthermore,   meta-rules have been used to guide project management practices (Bredillet 2010), and   facilitate the practical and critical decision making process in the French Navy (Gaultier   Le Bris 2014).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" University knowledge transfer activities exist at multiple levels and involve a wide   range of internal and external stakeholders such as general administrative staf, various   subject faculties, staf within dedicated research centres, knowledge transfer managers, uni�versity senior managers, government bodies, research funders, industry and societal stake�holders (Robinson et al. 2010; Miller et al. 2014).
";;;;;;;;"University–industry knowledge transfer comprises of two-directional fows of know�how, skills, capabilities and knowledge between collaborating partners (Guerrero et  al. 
2015; O’Shea et al. 2008)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Knowledge transfer in a university context is a term used to encapsulate a wide range of   activities ranging from less formal joint projects between universities and industry such as   joint publications, student projects and executive education to more formal collaborative   research, consultancy and start up activity (Alexander and Childe 2013; Perkmann et al. 
2013).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In this research, we identifed that the presence of barriers can be inherent to the deci�sion-making process and its application within organisations and not a result of any stra�tegic or structural defciencies. Consequently, we posit that universities already have the   critical capacity and potential for learning (Bellini et al. 2018) but encounter barriers when   they try to negotiate multi-level priorities internally or seek to reconcile existing, codifed   learning with tacit knowledge fows from new partnerships. Therefore, rather than suggest   a radical re-think of internal university governance, we operationalize the ‘meta-rule’ con�cept and present examples of its potential to help solve problems in establishing and man�aging knowledge transfer fows in a university–industry context.
";;This research identifes a number of future research directions will help overcome the   limitations of this research.

This research avoided the application of a prescriptive analytical framework in develop�ing our approach. The frameworks selected aid in illustrating our concept and to achieve an   element of ‘situational awareness’ of the complex environment within which an organisa�tions is operating (Davis 1980). Other frameworks exist (see, for example, Argote et  al. 
2003; Murray and Peyreftte 2007; Plewa et al. 2013) which further research should explore   to see if they aid the development and understanding of meta-rules.

We do this through the  novel approach of studying how these individual and organizational factors inffuenced  the outcomes of speciffc research projects, and in particular whether these projects  resulted in commercial outputs. ;;;;;;;;;;;Our operational research question is: Why do some research  projects generate commercial outputs while others do not?

This has occurred at both the national policy level  across countries, and also among the various institutional players associated with research  and innovation (Goldfarb and Henrekson, 2003; Gulbrandsen and Smeby, 2005). ";;;;;;;;"The data for this project examines 207 academic research projects funded by a major  research council in the United Kingdom. It provides a unique data set by combining  archival data concerning the inputs and outputs of the research projects with indepen�dently gathered survey data from the principal investigators of the projects. Our sam�pling frame is so-called ‘Responsive Mode’ research grants funded by the Engineering  and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and completed within the years  2003–05. As there is considerable variety in the composition and characteristics of these  projects, great care had to be taken in the research design.

It may be that they are not as important for the initial decision to commercialize as they  are for the success of the later stages of the process, but the result also leaves room  for speculation whether the existence of a TTO has merely a signalling effect for the  university’s commercial intentions or whether it actually provides evidence for a success�ful commercial track record.[10]";;"Our study does not come without limitations. We chose our sample of research  projects very carefully, focusing on collaborative research projects with certain pressures  to deliver against two objectives: academic as well as commercial. But of course this  creates non-trivial concerns about the generalizability of the ffndings. We would expect  these ffndings to apply to other contexts where research projects have the potential for  both academic and commercial outputs, but a setting where research projects were  focused much more on basic research or on purely commercial outputs would likely  exhibit rather different characteristics. With regard to generalizability to other countries,  the UK is among the most advanced countries in terms of public policy towards  commercialization (OECD, 2002) so we would expect to see similar ffndings in other  commercially-responsive countries where government-funded research councils support  university research projects.
Three other limitations are worth noting. First, our broad measure of commercial  outputs did not allow us to reveal potential differences between the conditions leading to  patenting, licensing and spin-out activities (see also Note 1). While these activities clearly  need different forms of management when they are being developed into profftable  ventures, it made sense to group them together as early indicators of commercial outputs  from academic research projects. ";;"Future research might, however, usefully look at the  different conditions that give rise to each different activity. Second, we wanted to develop  a high-quality measure of academic outputs to parallel our measure of commercial  outputs associated with the project, but this was impossible with this particular body of  data. We included the academic output from the research project at the end of the  funding period in our model, but we would have to wait several years to assess the quality  and impact of this research (e.g. through citations). This is certainly a direction where this  research can be extended in the future. Third, it was not possible to control for the  number of researchers who have left academia after the completion of successful research  projects to become entrepreneurs.

This paper takes a critical view of these   roles and reviews the extant literature to present a synopsis of relevant work   examining universities and open innovation, the uncertainties involved in the   process of knowledge transfer, and the spatial scope of university-industry   links.;;;;;;;;;;;" three   significant questions require addressing:   1 What are the implications for knowledge-based urban development of the fact that   some universities are more prone to collaborative engagement with firms than others   (Laursen and Salter, 2004; Huggins et al., 2012)? 
2 What are the implications for knowledge-based urban development of the existence   of uncertainties in the process of collaboration between firms and universities   (Lokshin et al., 2011)? ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The premise of the paper’s conceptual framework is that knowledge-based urban   development promotes the transformation of society through harnessing innovation in   order to promote development (Carrillo, 2008). Fundamentally, urban growth is   increasingly determined by capabilities of organisations to appropriate and utilise stocks   of knowledge through relational assets (Storper, 1997). Thus, the knowledge-based urban   development concept has emerged as a means of examining the roles of both knowledge   and networking as the central drivers of economic development (Knight, 1995, 2008;   Kunzmann, 2008; Yigitcanlar and Lönnqvist, 2013; Yigitcanlar, 2009). Knowledge-based   urban development relies on identifying the knowledge assets of urban environments   (Kunzmann, 2008; Lönnqvist et al., 2013), of which universities and their collaborative   linkages with firms have been identified as particularly important (Perry, 2008). 
Therefore, the dynamic interrelation of universities and firms, driven by both proximity   and networks, are crucial for promoting urban development (Benneworth and Ratinho,   (2014).

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This paper presents a critical overview of the role of universities in knowledge-based   urban development. In summary, the arguments presented in this paper suggest that   universities are rightly positioned at the centre of this process. As centres of knowledge   creation, absorption, and transfer they are uniquely placed to boost innovation through   engaging with organisations outside of academia (Thursby and Thursby, 2004; Huggins   et al., 2008; Goddard et al., 2014). As such, the broad policymaking focus on promoting   the development of U-I linkages appears to be well motivated (OECD, 2007; European   Commission, 2011; Wilson, 2012). 
Yet, while the policy focus on universities may be well motivated, the paper   highlights several factors that require further examination in order to clearly understand   the roles of universities in the knowledge-based urban development process and assess   the effectiveness of their knowledge transfer activities to the innovation activities of   firms. Firstly, the open innovation concept, while a useful theoretical framework for   understanding inter-organisational networks and knowledge transfer in the course of   knowledge-based urban development tends to frame the process as frictionless and   costless. Secondly, while knowledge spillover theories suggest that the knowledge   is in the air (Jaffe, 1989), this conceptualisation merely posits that universities are   creating knowledge in order for firms to utilise. Instead, the role of universities in   knowledge-based urban development may be better understood through a micro-level   examination of the process talking to the actors involved. Thus, this would allow a further   examination of both the technology and productivity spillovers that may occur as a result   of U-I links (Hermannsson et al., 2016).

The ffrst category, educational interaction, describes industry collab�oration with educational motives, including the channels conferences and  seminars, corporate training, and the supervision of theses (see Table 2).

The transfer of knowledge forms one of the principal axis of the third mission of the   university since this allows institutions of higher education and URC to contribute in the   solution of needs with economic and social impact. The evolutionary approach to the economy,   associates innovation with schemes that characterize it as the result of a process that takes place   in an economic, political and social environment in which a diversity of actors constituting the   National Innovation System are involved and linked (Freeman 1995; Lundval et al, 2002). The   interaction of URC with industry and in general with the productive sector is one of the crucial   elements of the innovation process. The scientific knowledge generated by research centers   is increasingly determined by the interaction between agents who use and reinterpret such   knowledge. This is a result of the growing importance and development of research work in the   contemporary university and also the effect of the progressive importance of knowledge as a   determinant of international competitiveness and the development of economies.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"According to the scheme, there are two main mechanisms in the knowledge transfer process. 
The first is one in which science is a driving force of transference from the side of the universities   “science push”. In the second “market pull” the demand pulls the process (Testar, 2012). In the   first case, knowledge is transmitted via consulting, training staff, technical assistance activities. 
In the second, the main modalities of transfer are contract research, research via joint projects,   and the sale or licensing of ownership of research results generated in universities. Channels of   interrelation between universities and firms can be either bottom-up or top-down. 
The first type is more spontaneous and corresponds to the case where actors who need   knowledge to solve technical problems or develop innovations meet (on their own initiative)   with actors that can provide knowledge. The second (top down) is characterized by the fact   that the linkage is concretized through formal and legal institutional mechanisms that propose   initiatives to strengthen relations between the university and the company (ECLAC, 2011). ";;;"The process of transferring knowledge from universities to   public and private users can be assimilated to a value chain, from the research carried out in   URC to their transformation into new or improved products or services which companies will   bring to market (Testar, 2012). Within this scheme, technology transfer is conceived as one of   the multiple ways through which the transference of knowledge can take place. In the field of   economic activities, we can characterise technology transfer as the process of incorporation   into a productive unit, of the knowledge developed outside it. The licensing agreements have   been one of the most important channels for the transfer of technology from the university   to private firms in developed countries. More often inventions emerging from universities   and URC labs need extensive development before an actual product or service is ready to be   marketed and used by the people. During the last decades, several entities have been established   whose purpose is to increase the likelihood that the knowledge and technological results of the   universities will be successfully commercialized, such as business incubators and accelerators,   science parks, technology transfer offices, interface units, and different forms of formal or   informal interaction between universities and companies (Sargent & Mathews, 2014; Puerta &   Jasso, 2018). Technology transfer is a complex process, which can follow different trajectories,   with universities, companies and economic development entities participating in different   phases. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The process of transferring knowledge from universities to public and private users can be   assimilated to a value chain, from the research carried out in the URC, to their transformation   into new or improved products or services that companies will bring to the market.
Two cases of knowledge transfer with practical applications of IIBm-UNAM to the company   Psicofarma, part of a 100% Mexican ownership pharmaceutical group (Neolpharma), were   identified. In both, the process begins on the basis of the scientific and inventive capabilities   of IIBm, following a scheme in which the generation of science is the initial factor that pushes   the process (science push). However, this can trigger a market pull process, once established   the long-term link between companies and universities, promoting research via joint projects. 
The transfer presupposes the strengthening of the university not only as an organization that   generates knowledge, but also as manager of itself. An important part for the transfer to occur is   the existence of a greater number of companies that in their strategy favor innovation. In the case   analyzed, we find that the Neolpharma Pharmaceutical Group has strengthened its relationship   with educational institutions and research centers, in order to promote innovation processes.
The challenge of university-business linkage seems to lie in how to reinforce the transfer   value chain in a double-flow scheme. This is on the one hand increasing the volume of research   results that have the potential to be incorporated in the transfer process (role of the universities),   and on the other hand to generate the conditions of an increased demand pull, that is to say   a growing set of significant companies and other private and public bodies that are able to   identify the innovative potential of knowledge generated in universities and to demand it.
In the chain of the innovative process, it is important to generate knowledge and the   existence of interface units, but so is the environment in which universities and companies are   developed. The existence (or not), of a critical mass of researchers, of institutional conditions   that foster linkage, or of a context that drives companies to innovate are necessary.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Over time, however, university research reduced  the incentives to invest in corporate labs by providing an increasingly attractive alternative: start-up invention. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"For instance, large firms may work on improving the architectural aspects of a product, whereas start�ups may focus on improving specific components. We call this heterogeneity in types of inventions. Second, even  though multiple start-ups can work on improving a single component (so that their inventions are substitutes), they  may do so by pursuing different approaches. This heterogeneity in approaches also benefits society because it ensures  that, even if one start-up fails, another may succeed.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Using a simple model, we show that, even in the absence of appropriability problems,  profit-maximizing firms may underinvest in internal research. In our model, large and small firms focus on solving  different problems. Large firms, for instance, may have an advantage at producing innovations that are more com�plex or costly than those produced by smaller firms or universities. Large firms can use their assets either to commer�cialize their internal inventions or to commercialize external inventions acquired from small firms. We show that,  although there are benefits in duplicating small firms’ research efforts (as any one small firm can fail), sometimes  large firms have an excessive incentive to engage in an “open innovation” strategy. The reason is that large firms  may win market share, even when these markets are already populated by other firms trying to commercialize similar  inventions. Society, on the other hand, would benefit from greater investment in internal research, as this would re�sult in greater diversity of innovations. Thus, the risk we highlight is that open innovation may tend to crowd out  more costly or architectural types of research done in large corporate labs.
In addition, of course, large firms’ research efforts may be plagued by appropriability problems. Research is an ac�tivity that is well known to produce important spillovers. Increasing competition, by exacerbating appropriability  problems, may reduce the private incentives to invest in internal research, even if its value to society is large.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ashyrov 2019 - The future of university–industry collaboration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Scenario analysis is  a process that uses discussion and data to make sense  of complex concepts (Bowman, 2016). Most scenario  planning in the intuitive logic school of thought is  designed following early papers in the ffeld (Bradffeld,  Wright, Burt, Cairns, & Van Der Heijden, 2005;  Schoemaker, 1995; Schoemaker & van der Heijden,  1992). The process follows a linear succession of four  stages. In the ffrst stage, the purpose is deffned, the  present situation is mapped, and the need for sce�nario analysis assessed (Chermack, Lynham, & van  der Merwe, 2006; Schwartz, 1991). In the second  stage, the key variables are determined usually with  these fftting within the PEST model (Political,  Economic, Socio-cultural, Technological) (Tapinos,  2012). In the third stage, the variables are ranked  and analysed in the context of their relative impor�tance, uncertainty, and impact. Most scenario ana�lyses use the two-axis diagram proposed by Van der  Heijden, Bradffeld, Burt, Cairns, and Wright (2002)  to evaluate this. Based on these axes, the fourth stage  sees scenarios being built based on the values of the  axes and the way the variables change according to  them.

First, to forecast the future of the KIE via scenario analysis, where U-I collaboration is  a dominant practice. Second, to use this forecast as a basis for providing policy suggestions. ;;;;;;;;;;;"There are two primary aims of this study. First, to  forecast the state of a KIE where U-I collaboration is  a widespread practice with the capability of bringing  together specialist knowledge providers and efffcient  value creators. In this way, forecasting will generate  fresh insights into the future of U-I collaborations and  enable us to understand knowledge ffows and technology  transfers between research laboratories and productive  sectors via U-I collaboration (Ferreira, Dana, & Ratten,  2017). Second, to analyse such a future and attempt to  provide policy suggestions aimed at achieving it. In par�ticular, analysing the future of U-I collaboration will  propose strategies for testing the strength of policies,  since all parties, such as universities, industry, and gov�ernment, should be able to comprehend what to do or not  to do and when.
";;;;;;;"Whether in the local or global context, the most heated  debates often revolve around the future success of the  economy. Knowledge, and the innovation that is  expected to stem from it, is considered as one of the  top priorities in many advanced countries (Lopez-Leyva  & Mungaray-Moctezuma, 2017; OECD, 1996).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Knowledge, unlike other  resources, increases when used and can be combined,  developed, and acquired (Amit & Schoemaker, 1993).
With universities by nature being the greatest sources  of knowledge in society (Brennenraedts, Bekkers, &  Verspagen, 2006; Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 2000), the  potential for combining this knowledge with economic  value creation is clearly of interest to many stakeholders.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In the ffrst stage, the purpose is deffned, the  present situation is mapped, and the need for sce�nario analysis assessed (Chermack, Lynham, & van  der Merwe, 2006; Schwartz, 1991). In the second  stage, the key variables are determined usually with  these fftting within the PEST model (Political,  Economic, Socio-cultural, Technological) (Tapinos,  2012). In the third stage, the variables are ranked  and analysed in the context of their relative impor�tance, uncertainty, and impact. Most scenario ana�lyses use the two-axis diagram proposed by Van der  Heijden, Bradffeld, Burt, Cairns, and Wright (2002)  to evaluate this. Based on these axes, the fourth stage  sees scenarios being built based on the values of the  axes and the way the variables change according to  them.
Our pap";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;They used various methods,  including PESTEL, benchmarking, analysis of the com�ponents of indexes (based on the Global Innovation  Index, European Innovation Scoreboard, the State of  the European University-Business Cooperation report,  OECD reports etc.), and brainstorming sessions to gain  an overview of the situation surrounding the aim  regarding the KIE. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Our main conclusion is also twofold. First, we con�clude that one of the main factors to aim towards a KIE  is free-market competition. This not often emphasised  in the literature on knowledge transfer and  U-I collaboration, but it is also understandable that  studies normally focus on past events. Nevertheless,  compared to previous work, this is similar to the  results reported by Connelly, Ford, Gallupe, Turel,  and Zweig (2009), which shows that competition is  a driver of knowledge transfer. In addition, it is impor�tant to work on legislation for emerging ffelds (e.g., AI,  privacy) (Goltz et al., 2018; Shields, 2018).
";;;;"There are several avenues for future work. In the  ffrst place, this study uses inputs from researchers, 18  doctoral students, and 3 professors, in the scenario  building process. Despite the advantage of this bene-  ffting from the views of advanced academics, there is  the disadvantage of the lack of contributions from  representatives of industry. The scenario building  process for predicting the state of the KIE and  U-I collaboration requires more divergent opinions  from all stakeholders, such as representatives of uni�versities, industries, and government. Future studies  could benefft from their broad input to improve the  analysis. Second, this work uses a case study of  Estonia, which has already achieved many steps  towards having a sustainable KIE and being an inno�vative country. Therefore, these conditions could  have inffuenced the scenarios and therefore also the  results. Future works may repeat a similar examina�tion by considering a different country and perform�ing a cross-country comparative analysis.

(2018), were used to   develop, an anonymous questionnaire. This was developed and sent to all academic staff   working within the institution via email where they were invited to undertake an assessment   as to the maturity of the university in terms of becoming an Entrepreneurial University using   a Likert scale from 1-10 indicating their level of agreement with each statement.
From this a mean score for each overall category was calculated in order to enable a   comparison between them. In addition, they were asked for their views on specific aspects of   an Entrepreneurial University and what they considered the most important factors were in   relation to aiding the case example’s university’s transition into an Entrepreneurial   University. This included asking for their views on changes in knowledge management,   knowledge-based systems; valorisation of knowledge assets; and entrepreneurship   ecosystems.

";;;;;UNIVERSITY   ENTREPRENEURIALISM ;"though being at the interface of knowledge creation and transfer. Globally, universities are   undergoing intense transformation to meet the challenges of a knowledge-based economy. 
Stonkienė & Matkevičienė (2014), as key stakeholders in innovation systems and the   production and dissemination of knowledge, they face increasing scrutiny about their ability   to tackle the demands of “fast business”, societal change and technological development   (Bejinaro, 2017).
The entrepreneurial role of universities has been explored most frequently in more   traditional market-economy countries, and their role in developing countries such as Jordan   has been much less considered (Vadi & Haldman, 2010).";This new role is   often referred to as the “entrepreneurial” university (Riviezzo et al., 2017). According to   Cunningham et al. (2017), entrepreneurial universities have become significant contributors   for regions and countries in relation to the achievement of economic and social development ;;;;;"As a distinct educational subject, entrepreneurship has evolved beyond the notion that   “entrepreneurs are born” and instead it is more widely accepted that there are some aspects   of entrepreneurship can be cultivated and learned with the numbers of universities offering   entrepreneurship courses increasing dramatically in recent years (Qureshi et al., 2016).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Respondents were first asked to indicate where they felt the case example university   was positioned in terms of its current entrepreneurial status in relation to criteria covered   under the 7 domains identified in the OECD (2012) guiding framework. Respondents   indicated their level of agreement with each criterion statement under each of the categories   on a scale of 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 10 (Strongly Agree), and an overall mean score for   each category was calculated. 
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Following a systematic review of the current literature, and using a   quantitative methodology, supported by a pragmatist theoretical approach, this study used an   online anonymous survey to gather the views and perceptions of university academic staff   about the entrepreneurial maturity of their own institution specifically, and more generally   about the knowledge management factors which can promote entrepreneurialism in academic   institutions in developing countries.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; This study explored, from the perspective of its staff, the extent to which a   Jordanian University has become entrepreneurial and to examine the knowledge   management factors which are most important in making this transition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Leadership and governance are critical factors in developing an entrepreneurial mind   set within higher education institutions (Ilie et al., 2017). Increasingly, such institutions are   adopting a business-like leadership and management approach to keep up to date with other   organisations competing in the information economy (Blaschke et al., 2014). According to   Etzkowitz & Dzisah (2015), entrepreneurial university leadership teams need to comprise of   leaders from both academic and non-academic backgrounds in order to generate the right   entrepreneurial attitudes and strategic vision, and to have the capacity to generate both robust   academic development and effective societal engagement. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Knowledge preservation is often considered to be one of the more traditional roles of   a university (Ilnytskyy, 2015), but is sometimes considered to be a neglected area (Shaffiei et   al., 2013). According to Kianto et al. (2016) knowledge preservation is associated with the   management of human resources in order to ensure the retention of expertise. Other   commentators have suggested that it is associated with the quality and integrity of knowledge   and the security of archiving research information and repositories (Abubakar & Attahir,  2018). The preservation of knowledge in either of these associations is a key concern for   institutions striving to become “Entrepreneurial Universities” and needs to be taken account   of in its wider human resource management and information technology strategies.
";Knowledge sharing relates to the transmission and dissemination of knowledge both   internally and more widely across organisational boundaries (Jali et al., 2017). However,   despite this being viewed as an essential component of knowledge management in   universities, studies have shown that it is not always achieved effectively (Tan, 2016).;Knowledge use or application involves organisations implementing new knowledge   into their existing systems and practices allowing them to strengthen their product   development and innovation capabilities and authenticating and testing out research findings   in the “real environment” (Abbas et al., 2018). Within this process of knowledge   management sits the concept of knowledge valorisation whereby the transfer of academic   knowledge to parties in the commercial sector results in the creation of societal value by   translating research findings into innovative products, services and processes (Hladchenko,   2016). ;According to O'Reilly & Robbins (2018), the knowledge transfer capabilities of   universities have been difficult to quantify and to make comparisons between institutions and   the OECD (2012) argue that measurement in this respect is underdeveloped. However, an   Entrepreneurial University would be one where mechanisms to quantify and demonstrate   evidence of economic and societal impact were well established. Furthermore, as Kaklauskas   et al. (2018) point out, when measuring impact, there needs to be consideration given to the   wider concept of decision making which takes account of a range of factors such as those   which are behavioural, cognitive, cultural and ethical. ;;;;;;"In the context of universities, knowledge acquisition is a strategy intended to bring in   new knowledge and experience from the surrounding environment into the university and   may, for example, take the form of hiring in specialists in the field to work in the university   (Bratianu & Bejinaru, 2017). From a business perspective, knowledge acquisition from   universities can help firms to solve technological problems related to product and process   innovations, which in turn can enhance commercial performance (Takanashi & Lee, 2019).
";;;;Knowledge creation is essential associated with the development of new knowledge  (Jali et al., 2017), and universities are inevitably seen as a major source of new knowledge   (Ghio et al., 2016). However, in order for academic institutions to achieve the status of an;;"Knowledge management has been defined in many different   ways but it is generally agreed that in the context of universities, it is the process through   which the institution increases its intellectual capital to generate benefits through its   transference to the social environment (Ramirez et al., 2017).
Following an extensive review of knowledge management processes, Raudeliūnienė,   et al. (2018) identified that most researchers focus on the following five knowledge   management processes: knowledge creation; knowledge sharing; knowledge use; knowledge   acquisition; and knowledge preservation. It the categorisation of these processes which have   informed the development of this study";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The development of external relationships between universities and industry faces a   number of challenges due to the heterogeneous groups of actors involved, each of which have   its own distinct characteristics, purposes and structures (Martinelli et al., 2008). Associated   with this is consideration of the ecosystems in which universities and businesses operate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The findings indicated that although the case example university was  perceived as progressing well towards its aim of becoming an Entrepreneurial University, it   was evident that institutions such as this face a number of barriers which is perhaps more   prominent in a developing country like Jordan, where higher education is still more   commonly viewed through a traditional lens. However, the findings indicated a good level of   support for the use of entrepreneurial centres to act as business incubators, and there was an   appetite for forging stronger links with businesses and on learning outside of the traditional   university context. Furthermore, the findings suggested that the focus towards   entrepreneurialism had led to improvements in knowledge transfer and application processes   in particular, but that going forward academia and industry alike need to continue to adapt   and change, align and strengthen knowledge management, and work collaboratively to   achieve the archetype “third mission” with mutual benefits for all;;Although this study has added to the body of evidence within this field, a mixed   methodology combining interviews with academic staff and local business leaders may have   enhanced the richness of the information gathered and a comparison between different   universities may also be an area for further investigation. Furthermore, a deeper dive into the   specific ways in which knowledge management processes have changed in the pursuit of   entrepreneurialism would be beneficial;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

By def�inition, during the consultancy work, the design knowledge that  was transferred from university to industry was not the same  as the fabrication knowledge transferred informally from indus�try to the university. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Rappert et al.

We collected information and evidence from  multiple sources (as is usual in case studies, George and Bennett,  2005) and analysed it in light of our interest in the dynamic inter�actions among and localization of formal and informal knowledge  transfer channels.;;;;;;"The focal patent was developed during a period (the late 1980s)  when the ffeld of MEMS was starting to coalesce in a coherent  manner: the terminology used was homogenized and practical  application of the knowledge advanced:  Before MEMS was named in 1987–we kind of named the ffeld–  in Europe it would be microsystems. Nano systems in the US is  MEMS or NEMS, and in Asia [. . .]. But in the ’80s. . . people were  beginning to think of things that were beginning to be more  manufactureable.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" The relationship between the design knowl�edge transferred via formal consultancy activity and the fabrication  knowledge transferred from industry to university (and, ultimately,  to local entrepreneurs through the WMLA programme) did not  seem to raise concerns over property rights, which suggests that, in  these kinds of dynamic interactions, knowledge generated during  formal transfer activities could be transferred via informal chan�nels.
";;"From a theoretical point of view, this case study illustrates  the limitation of current approaches to explain the complex and  dynamic interactions underlying in knowledge transfer processes.
Hearing the protagonists’ voices enabled us to acquire a closer  perspective to the micro-realm of such processes. This closer  look highlighted the importance of characterizing technological  knowledge as ‘design’ or ‘production’ knowledge, as proposed in  Walter Vincenti’s (1990) work on epistemology of technology.
This typology allowed us to understand the relationship between  the production knowledge informally transferred from industry to  university and the design knowledge transfer involved in formal  collaborations. Prior university-industry research on knowledge  channels has sometimes used instead the division between tacit  and codiffed knowledge (see Mowery and Ziedonis, 2015 for a  recent example), despite its imprecision (Cowan et al., 2000). In  our research we found Vincenti’s approach more appropriate for  analysing our data, a circumstance which could inform the design  of subsequent studies (both qualitative and quantitative) on knowl�edge transfer.
";;"Our emphasis in the temporally unfolding, sequential character  of knowledge transfer through different channels could encour�age future work to generate systematic quantitative evidence to  test propositions related with the sequence of channels. For exam�ple, through survey questionnaires or crossing citation databases  with university funding databases, future studies could examine  whether ffrms citing universities are the same as ffrms contracting  universities, and the sequence of citations and contracts.

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This paper intends to give an overview of the debates surrounding the introduction  of the Bayh-Dole Act in the USA, and the possible adoption of similar legislation  in Europe. The aim of the paper is not to provide the final answer to the question  whether Europe needs legislation similar to the Bayh-Dole Act. Rather, the ambition  is to provide an overview of the academic literature in economics that deals with  university patenting, and to draw policy lessons from this. ;;;;;;;;;;;"The survey will focus on two main issues. First,  which arguments can be given in favour of university patenting to facilitate public–  private knowledge interaction, and what empirical evidence exists to support (or not)  these arguments? Second, how do these arguments fit into the specific European  context? This second issue is important because, as will be shown below, the  European situation is different in many respects from the US context.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The patent system recognizes the trade-off between providing incentives and  enabling the flow of knowledge. Thus, a major element of any patent system is that  all patented knowledge must be made public (in the actual patent document), that  not all knowledge related to the patent becomes the property of the patent holder,  and that there is a maximum time length of the patent (after which the patented  knowledge becomes public property).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Knowledge is an important  factor of production, and leads to both greater varieties of consumption goods and  increased productivity in producing them. The fact that this production factor is,  in principle, non-rivalrous, leads to strong economies of scale. Using knowledge  throughout the global economic system can in principle be realized at relatively  little extra cost in addition to the costs induced by the original developer of the  knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Intellectual property rights are a rather special and difficult policy field. The  patent system, both in a broad sense (where issues of patent scope are important)  and in the specific sense of university patenting, is a system that must strike a  balance in a trade-off between granting rights (and thus incentives) to an inventor,  and leaving enough scope for positive benefits (technology spillovers) to society at  large. Obviously, stronger patents are not always better. Because it is not always  easy to identify on which side of the optimal trade-off the current situation lies,  it is difficult for policy makers to design an optimal policy. This holds a fortiori  for the topic of university patents. The issue of whether university patents facilitate  technology transfer is hard to investigate in a quantitative way, and it is again  likely that the answer differs on a case-to-case basis. The potential disadvantages  of university patents are equally difficult to quantify. We are thus left with the  impression of a policy field in which ‘muddling-through’ is the way in which policy  must proceed: any decisions are necessarily based on incomplete information, and  will be hard to evaluate. This does not imply that no policies should be made, or  that existing policies should not be changed. On the contrary, it implies that policy  makers must be like entrepreneurs, ready to implement new ideas, willing to take  the risk of failure, and able to admit when this has happened.
In line with this, the debate cannot easily be concluded at a theoretical level.
Arguments against and in favour of increased university patenting both exist. On  the ‘positive’ side of the scales is the potential beneficial impact on technology  transfer. On the negative side, several arguments can be raised: the danger to the  ‘open culture of science’, a potential incentive for universities to perform more  applied (less ‘basic’) research (to become more like firms), and the potential of  ‘strategic’ patents to block future progress in an area.";;;;More research on the links between university researchers and the private sector  is necessary to further enlighten these issues.

First, from the theoret�ical point of view, we considered learning and knowledge transfer in collaboration arrange�ments between frms and universities, whereas most of the previous literature has analysed   inter-frm cooperation (Lane et al. 2001; Nielsen and Nielsen 2009; Simonin 199";;;;;;;;;;;;;; He defned collaborative know-how as the ability of a frm to “develop   specialized knowledge via experience and then use this knowledge to obtain further ben�efts” (Simonin 1997, p. 1150). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"It is therefore not surprising that the number of frms involved in relationships with   external partners, including other frms and universities, has steadily increased over the   last few decades (Bellucci and Pennacchio 2016; Jacob et al. 2000; Perkmann et al. 2011). 
University–industry (UI) cooperation, in particular, has received growing levels of atten�tion from scholars and policy-makers in national and European programs (Hagedoorn   et al. 2000; Lehrer et al. 2009). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;All the items used to build the latent variables were measured on a fve-point Likert-type   scale. The latent variable Collaborative experience was composed of 10 items representing   diferent types of collaborative channels between frms and universities. The construct Col�laborative know-how was a latent variable built from two other variables designed using   Simonin’s (1997) collaboration cycle: partner selection (Collaborative selection) and man�agement of the collaboration (Collaborative management). Collaborative selection (KH1)   was calculated as the average value of three items refecting the frm’s ability to scan for   university competence (KH1c) and select an appropriate partner (KH1a and KH1b). Col�laborative management was measured using eight items capturing tools and strategies used   to deploy internal and external resources (from KH2a to KH2h). The items concerned the   use of formal or informal collaboration (KH2a and KH2b), specifc managers or other   workers for the management of the relationships with universities (KH2c, KH2f), for�mal plans of activities (KH2d, KH2e and KH2h), and software for project management   (KH2g).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"To measure the output of collaborations, we built two constructs. Tangible benefts was   based on three items covering the direct impact of cooperation on the frm’s activities:   development of new products (TB1), improvement of internal production processes (TB2),   and development of business (TB3). Intangible benefts captured learning and knowledge   transfer and was built from two items: satisfaction with the collaboration (ITB1); and   acquisition of new knowledge/skills from the relationship (ITB2).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The model was empirically tested on a sample of ICT frms from the Campania region   of Italy. All these frms had established relationships with universities during the period   2006–2009. The results support the theoretical assumptions that collaborative experience   has a positive efect on the benefts from UI cooperation, and showed that collaborative   know-how and trust are signifcant mediating mechanisms between collaborative experi�ence and gaining benefts from cooperation with universities. These fndings suggest that   repeated interactions over time contribute in building collaborative know-how and trust,   which in turn can be used by frms to fully beneft from future collaborations with universi�ties. Collaborative know-how is therefore a distinct capability, and not the same as experi�ence in collaboration, although the latter is useful and necessary to develop the former. Our   study also emphasizes the critical role played by trust in ensuring the efectiveness of UI   relationships.
We found empirical evidence of heterogeneous efects on two diferent types of benefts:   tangible and intangible. Trust was the major driver of tangible benefts, while Collabora�tive know-how was more important for learning and intangible benefts.
";;;"This study has expanded knowledge about university–industry relationships, but it also has   some limitations that call for future research. The existing literature on knowledge transfer   and learning in alliances has emphasized the important role of collaborative know-how   and trust, but other elements may also infuence the relationship between collaborative   experience and the outcome of UI cooperation. Our results show that collaborative know�how and trust have a partial mediating efect on this relationship. Martinez et al. (2017)   showed, however, that also human capital is a fundamental driver of frms’ innovation   performance in high-technology industries because it strengthens the positive impact of   alliance partner diversity. Similarly, specialized human capital within frms operating in   science-based industries could be an important resource in translating external knowledge   and previous collaborative experience into stronger benefts from cooperation with univer�sities. In addition, Nielsen and Nielsen (2009) argued that partnerships’ governance mode   may be relevant to the benefts achieved by frms. Therefore, a promising avenue for future   research would be to explore other possible channels through which collaborative experi�ence increases the benefts from UI cooperation.
We considered the relationships between industry and university only from the point   of view of frms. Future research should investigate the university perspective, as this has";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A European Commission (2017) report highlights  that, in recent years, the university’s traditional  approaches to teaching have shifted towards a more  pro-active, inquiry-based, co-creative model.

";Although U-I links and their impact on innovation  processes have been a long-standing target of analysis  (Mascarenhas, Ferreira, & Marques, 2018), previous  studies have mainly focused on activities that provide  economic value to academic research (Perkmann  et al., 2013). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"● Basic information: Founder, initiative (private or  public), foundation date and web trafffc.

We analysed educational  crowdsourcing platforms as a new way to promote  this kind of collaboration and investigated the role of  such platforms in the development of U-I joint activ�ities in undergraduate or graduate programmes.
Three main categories have been identiffed based on  their scope: (i) platforms that track the full learning  experience, (ii) platforms with a predominant focus  on crowdsourcing, and (iii) platforms oriented  towards networking. Main features are discussed  and contrasted. Beneffts arising from the integration  of such platforms within the design and delivery of  university curricula have been highlighted. Notably,  these platforms lend meaning to the learning process,  help build an educational model that is relevant to  society and better prepare students for the labour  market whilst promoting international experience.

Second, we examine the  organizational changes undertaken by PREOs to promote improve  ‘entrepreneurial attitudes’ among academic researchers. Third, we  explore the speciffcities of university–industry collaboration in  emergent and mature industries.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;In this study, we explore and discuss the  role of university–industry collaboration for the development of innovation in mature and emergent  industries in new industrialized countries;;;;;;;;;;;" this paper should be seen as a ffrst step towards understand�ing whether and how the characteristics of university–industry  interactions in mature and emergent industries differ, and as  providing preliminary evidence to guide managers, and sci�ence and technology policy makers in NICs. The present study  focuses on Brazil, where since 2003 policy has been aimed at  improving national technological capabilities and supporting the  development and growth of high-technology industries (Brazilian  Government, 2003; Gouvea and Kassicieh, 2005).
";;;;;;;"The innovative environments of mature low and medium tech�nology industries and emergent high-technology industries differ  considerably in terms ofmarket and technology turbulence, and the  characteristics of knowledge inputs. Consequently, search strate�gies for innovation inputs, the role of networking and collaboration  for innovation development, and eventual innovative outputs also  differ (Utterback and Abernathy, 1975; Tushman and Anderson,  1986; Strebel, 1987; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000).

In  mature industries, innovation involves the ‘management of knowl�edge bases distributed across a set of agents and institutions’  (Robertson and Smith, 2008: 100; von Tunzelmann, 2009).";;" In the early stages of an industry life cycle,  new knowledge inputs and resources, such as university research,  may enhance the agglomeration of innovative activity, while the  new knowledge embodied in skilled workers favours clustering  in all phases of the industry cycle (Audretsch and Stephan, 1996;  Audretsch, 1998).

Informal and professional  networks of PREOs and industry researchers in emergent activities  are underdeveloped compared to the networks of mature indus�tries. Moreover, national public support for university–industry  collaboration in emergent industries is dispersed across differ�ent public organizations/programmes. Therefore, in contrast to  projects with ffrms active in mature industries, university R&D  projects with ffrms active in emergent industries are less likely  to be the result of academics’ initiative and public research;;"It should be noted that this study has some limitations. First,  it focuses on data collected from the university partner in the col�laboration. It would be interesting to investigate the perspectives  of industry in order to better understand the motivations for and  barriers to collaborating with universities, and to capture industry  differences in these motivations between emergent and mature  industry ffrms. This is a common limitation since very few con�tributions in the university–industry literature use data on both  collaboration partners (Bekkers and Bodas Freitas, 2008 is one of  the very few exceptions). Second, in order to extract detailed infor�mation on the characteristics of collaborations, our analysis was  carried out using unique project level data collected from inter�views with PREO directors and, necessarily, relies on a small sample  of observations. This restricts the type of statistical analysis that  is possible, and makes our results exploratory. Further research  is needed to expand the size of the sample and to exploit differ�ent methods of enquiry and analysis. Third, this is a single country  study. It would be interesting to analyse the extent to which these  results can be generalized to other countries given that cross�countrydifferencesmay exist betweenspeciffc academic,industrial  and political contexts. Some studies show that some economies  have institutional systems that create positive complementarities  for new business ffrms while in others the incentives are aimed  at and absorbed by large established ffrms (Chesbrough, 1999;  Gittelman, 2006).

Bonardo 2009 - The M_A dynamics of European science-based entrepreneurial firms;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;In this paper, we analyse the M&A activity of innovative ffrms that went public in Europe  in the period from 1995 to 2003. The list of IPO ffrms is from the EURIPO database that  includes all of the IPOs that took place in Europe over the last decade.3;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In all our regression models, we used a common set of explaining variables grouped in  four categories: baseline regression variables, institutional afffliation, intellectual capital,  and ownership and corporate governance.15 We included in the baseline regression a set of  control variables that could have inffuenced post-IPO M&A activity: (1) ffrm size, mea�sured by the natural logarithm of market capitalization at the IPO; (2) ffrm leverage,  measured by the debt to total assets ratio at the IPO; (3) ffrm profftability, measured by  return on assets at the IPO; (4) market to book, measured by the ratio between market and  book value of equity at the IPO; and (5) a series of dummy variables for industry, countries  and year speciffcities. Our most important theoretical variables referred to institutional  afffliation. We used dummy variables to test the effect of university afffliation and pre-IPO  VC ffnancing. Moreover, we took into consideration the effect of intellectual capital by";"We utilized several variables of four typologies: (1) general characteristics of the ffrms,  (2) intellectual capital, (3) ownership and corporate governance, (4) M&A characteris�tics. Firm-speciffc variables were measured at the IPO and were considered as possible  determinants of M&A activity. M&A-speciffc variables encompassed several aspects in  order to identify the aim and the relevance of M&A activity in the evolution of our  sample ffrms. When sample ffrms were targets of M&A deals, we distinguished between  the acquisition of minority interests (just being a target) and the acquisition of a ffrm’s  control (identiffed as control transfer M&As). Precise deffnitions of the variables are  provided in Table 2.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;Regarding human capital, a ffourishing literature has investigated the contribution of  universities to the creation of science-based entrepreneurial ffrms (SBEFs), which are  considered to be a key driver of the rejuvenation of European innovative industries  (Djokovic and Souitaris 2008). ;;;;;;;The role of human capital in M&A deals is also of great interest. Business transfers  involve important human resource ffows that facilitate division of labour, with individuals  changing jobs to pursue other development opportunities (Holms and Schmitz 1990). The  M&A market therefore promotes the upgrading of a ffrm’s human capital. However,  upgrades may be not limited to human resources. They may also involve physical and  technological capital, so that companies may specialize in either internal development of  R&D or acquisitions (Blonigen and Taylor 2000). Companies with internally available  resources are expected to show less interest in seeking external technology acquisitions  through M&As and, at the same time, they may be more frequent targets in the M&A  market;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;SBEFs  University spin-offs  Science-based entrepreneurship   Europe  IPOs  M&As;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; science-based  entrepreneurial ffrms;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This paper investigates the dynamics of a sample of 131 science-based  entrepreneurial ffrms (SBEFs), selected out of 500 innovative small and medium enter�prises (SMEs) that went public in Europe in the period 1995–2003. ;;;;;;;;;;;In this prospect, it is of interest to analyse how the decision to go public affects the  evolution of the ffrms, particularly with respect to the relationship with M&As. ;;;;;;;Access to sources of knowledge and innovation, as well as access to  physical resources, such as university laboratories and libraries, are key value adding  factors (Quintas et al. 1992).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"University afffliation may have a signiffcant impact on the strategies that ffrms pursue.
From a resource-based perspective of the ffrm, the resource conffguration of a company is  related to its evolution and performance (Barney et al. 2001). It is well documented in the  literature that companies obtain beneffts and resource endowments from their afffliations  with universities. Access to sources of knowledge and innovation, as well as access to  physical resources, such as university laboratories and libraries, are key value adding  factors (Quintas et al. 1992).

The regressions also tested the inffuence of other factors, such as  VC-backing, intellectual capital, and ownership structure or corporate governance.14 The  ffrst model consisted of a Poisson regression used to investigate the propensity of sample  ffrms to grow through M&As. The dependent variable in this model was the number of  acquisitions pursued by sample ffrms after ffoatation. We also analysed the relevance of  M&As in the process of divestment of original shareholders after the IPO. First, we used  Cox proportional hazard regressions to investigate which characteristics of the ffrm at the  IPO improved the probability of it becoming a target (at least one time) after ffoatation. We  then focused on companies that had transferred their control after the IPO. We studied the  temporary distribution of the probability to be acquired after the IPO (targeted in a deal, or a  sequence of deals, where the control stake of the company was transferred), and we used a  Cox proportional hazard regression (where the output variable was equal to 1 if the control  equity stake of the ffrm was acquired) to investigate the determinants of this probability.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Examining the characteristics of the framework that links M&A and IPO markets, this  paper addresses the role of institutional afffliation on the M&A dynamics of IPO ffrms  and ffnds that university afffliation does inffuence ffrm evolution. First, we found that  SBEFs have a higher probability of being acquired, relative to their independent coun�terparts. In particular, the market for the control of these ffrms is quite active, as most of  our sample SBEFs were acquired soon after their IPOs, most often by ffrms operating  within the same industry. Hence the attractiveness of university-based ffrms is strong,  while their relatively low profftability may reffect a deffcient matching between tech�nological expertise and managerial competencies. To this extent, an active M&A market  may be an effective instrument leading to a better fft between technological and ffnancial  capital.
";;As for most papers, some limitations of our analysis need to be noted. First, we relied on  a sample of IPO ffrms, which, as such, can be viewed as a positive selection of successful  SBEFs. However, we have found a distribution of university-based IPOs among industries  similar to previous studies that considered SBEFs in an earlier stage of their life cycle (see  for example, Smith and Ho 2006). Moreover, several differences between university-based  companies and independent ones that we found at the IPO have also been evidenced in  previous comparative studies (see for example, Colombo and Piva [2007] for TMT edu�cational capital). Nevertheless, the extent to which university-based companies at the IPO  differ from academic start-ups remains unresolved, and this may be a further issue to  investigate. This analysis may also reveal the resource endowments and the characteristics  that improve the success probability of an academic business initiative. Second, we have  considered TMT membership of academics at the ffoatation, ignoring their post-IPO  evolution. ;;" Future research may investigate this issue, analysing the behaviour of  researchers and academics with regards to their TMT positions after the listing, and when  the company is taken over.

We do not  ignore university researchers’ collaborations with those in industry or other sectors, but in  this review academic researchers are the collaborators of interest.
";;;;;;;;;;;"Focusing on university research, we examine two quite different strains of research  outputs including: (1) work focused on collaborations aimed chieffy at expanding the base of  knowledge and enhancing academic researchers’ reputation and careers; and (2) work  focused on collaborations dedicated, at least in part, on producing economic value and wealth  for the researchers.";;;;;;;"The ffnal organizational structure deffned by Chompalov et al.

While participatory collaboration can be  quite effective, it requires that participants hold egos in check and respect one another’s  opinion.
";;"4.1.3 Gender  Much of the work of Bozeman and colleagues (Bozeman and Corley 2004; Bozeman and  Gaughan 2011) focuses on personal attributes, examining personal attributes, especially  gender, in relation to collaboration patterns and accumulated ‘‘scientiffc and technical  human capital’’ (Bozeman et al. 2001).

The authors ffnd that collaborations across disciplinary boundaries report as many  positive outcomes as single-discipline projects, but projects spanning university boundaries  more often have negative outcome;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"We identify three main attribute  categories that are consistently analyzed in the literature including collaborator attributes,  attributes about the collaboration in general, and speciffc organizational or institutional  attributes. Each of these categories contains subcategories that further organize the liter�ature into a cohesive framework that contributes to understanding of the relationship  between additionality and R&D impacts and we include articles from each subcategory.
We begin with a systematic review of articles focusing on each of our attribute categories  and subcategories, focusing heavily on articles published after Katz and Martin’s 1997  review.";;4.1.2 Age  Age is certainly one of the most apparent personal factors one might expect to have an  effect on collaborations. Thus, it is surprising that relatively few studies have examined the  effects of age and career age on collaboration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Ponomariov and Boardman (2010), examining academic faculty afffliated with uni�versity research centers, ffnd no signiffcant relationship between researchers’ career age  and their number of publications with industrial collaborators, at least not after controlling  for a number of potentially confounding variables. This ffnding is perhaps less counter�intuitive than it might seems. ;;;;"academic entrepreneurship research collaborations. Naturally, these are not hard and fast  categories inasmuch as a great deal of the work on academic entrepreneurship considers the  impacts and practical uses of knowledge-focused research. Likewise, there is a growing  literature, mostly sharply critical, examining the effects of ffows in the other direction, the  impact of academic entrepreneurship (pejoratively referred to as ‘‘academic capitalism’’) on  product-focused research (Slaughter and Leslie 1997; Rhoades and Slaughter 1997).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The former literature we refer to as knowledge-focused research col�laborations and the other as property-focused research collaborations, including most;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; We deffne collaboration as ‘‘social  processes whereby human beings pool their human capital for the objective of producing  knowledge.’’ By this deffnition, collaboration need not be focused on publishing articles  and, indeed, collaborations often are more concerned with technology development, soft�ware or patents and may have no publication objective at any point. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; S&T human capital and research collaboration  Especially with regards to collaborations between universities and industry research shows  that knowledge is transferred from universities to the business sector largely through  human capital (Schartinger et al. 2001). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Beyond outputs. A good deal of the research on collaboration includes reasonable and  valid output measures. Indeed, this is an improvement over much of the work in ffelds  related to technology and knowledge management. Less, and are studies that go  beyond such outputs as patents and licenses produced to examine whether, in fact, the  volume of such outputs made any difference at all. This is a problem one ffnds more  often in property focused studies of collaboration. For those interested in knowledge  focused collaborations advances and bibliometric techniques have been useful for at  least determining one sort of impact, citations.
";;"While some research attempts to get at motives, usually either through surveys or  interviews, but motive-centered, researcher-centered studies are not the norm. But there  is now greater need to understand the complexity of collaboration calculus. Confficts  among centers, industries and traditional academic departments were not so important  decades ago. Abundant resources, no longer the norm, also had a tendency to reduce  complexity. But with declining grant money and fewer academic positions in most ffelds,  competitive dynamics intercede to a degree not common in the past. It seems to us that  the research has had a very difffcult time keeping pace with the changes in the  researchers’ environment.
Despite these and other limitations of the literature on research collaboration, it seems to  us that considerable strides have been made. If we take as a chronological benchmark Katz  and Martin’s (1997) excellent review of collaboration literature, one that was in some  respects similar to our own review, we can see signs of progress. The research proposition  table provided in the ‘‘Appendix’’ of this paper well veriffes this point. Not only have we  seen many more studies since the turn of millennium, but also entirely new aspects of  collaboration have been examined, often with entirely new analytical tools. Summary  assessment: much progress, much work remaining.
";;Another concern we have in regards to collaboration research is that few studies  examine the personal relationships between collaborators and the collaboration process in  general. This is a theory problem but also one of method. In order to truly examine  interpersonal relationships and the comprehensive process of collaboration, researchers  must move beyond simple demographic measures of subjects. Large surveys and inter�views of academic scientists must be conducted so we can understand if these demographic  factors are actually salient in the decision-making process when considering a collabora�tive project. We must also understand the intangibles that cannot be measured by biblio�metric analysis of published works and the demographic characteristics of the authors. We  must in particular understand more about the psychological antecedents to research;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Whereas new ffrm formation played  the key role of knowledge generator in the 1980s, the results  of social network analysis indicate that the number of spin�offs and the degree of knowledge transfer within the region  through this form of commercialization of primary research  is on the decline (Xu, 2003).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Yet many policymakers still view  research universities as potential ‘knowledge factories’ for  the new economy (David, 1997), with untapped reser�voirs of commercializable knowledge waiting to be taken  up by ffrms and applied. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This shift depends on the  recognition that the adoption and diffusion of new knowl�edge by ffrms involves the transfer of both codiffed and tacit  knowledge through a process of interactive and social learn�ing (Lundvall, 1992, 2004; Maskell, 2001; Gertler, 2004)";;;;"The ffow of knowledge does drive innova�tion, but knowledge transfer from universities to industry  is a ffuid, complex and iterative process involving many  different actors. As a consequence, the role of univer�sities in technology transfer and commercialization is  much more nuanced than traditional linear conceptions of  the innovation process assume (Stokes, 1997; Branscomb,  1997).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Beyond commercialization: “Little R, Big D” and  getting the ffrst look  Beyond the ability to produce, attract and retain tal�ent in the region, universities also provide critical research  support to local industry. The literature on the economic  impact of university licensing and spin-offs which empha�sizes commercialization downplays the more difffcult to  measure, but still important, mechanisms for transferring  knowledge to local industry. Betts and Lee (2005) identify  several other types of tech transfer that directly involve  partnerships between universities and industry. In spon�sored research agreements, a ffrm subsidizes or wholly  funds university research in return for preferential, rather  than exclusive, access to research results, or ‘getting the ffrst  look’. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The intention of this research has been to shed light  on the distinctive dynamics at work when a university  not only develops academic excellence in disciplines with  direct research applications to industry, such as software  engineering, but also sets out explicitly to develop link�ages with industry for the purposes of regional economic  development. To do this, we argue that knowledge trans�fer mechanisms from universities are far more robust than  the linear conception of commercialization implies. The  University of Waterloo stands out as a particularly suc�cessful instance of an ‘entrepreneurial research university’  that is deeply engaged in the local high-tech industrial  community. Despite obvious societal beneffts to increased  university–industry interaction, however, this is not to  suggest that an entrepreneurial university is in any way  qualitatively superior to a traditional one. Universities gen�erate and disseminate knowledge as a common good.
The central lesson that emerges from this study is the  inestimable benefft of combining a world-class academic  reputation for teaching and research with the nurturing  of an ‘entrepreneurial attitude of mind’ among faculty and  students. The University of Waterloo has been particularly  effective at both.

The primary knowledge exchange  mechanisms are Knowledge Integration Communities  (KICs) comprising academic researchers, industry par�ticipants, government policymakers and educators, who  collaborate on “multifaceted solutions” to address techno�logical, economic, and social issues (Acworth, 2008). The  University of Twente, a new, poorly endowed university in  a peripheral region in the Netherlands, like the University  of Waterloo, also developed a “strong entrepreneurial  vision” and was able to facilitate entrepreneurial academic  spin-off activity and generate and employ talent on a local  level, as well as develop research excellence in several  emerging areas of science and engineering (Lazzeretti and  Tavoletti, 2005). In response to policy directions begun in  the 1990s, Sweden has experimented with different modes  of university–industry linkages, and Chalmers University  of Technology was transformed into an “entrepreneurial”  university. However, in this case, an emphasis on commer�cialization without the appropriate macro-institutional  supports and micro-institutional, or university level,  ffexibility, has made the experience comparatively prob�lematic and lackluster, substantiating the assertion that  the presence of a strong research university in itself is  no guarantee of regional economic growth (Jacob et al.,  2003).

Bruno Fischer (2020) - Knowledge transfer for frugal innovation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The research strategy begins with an in-depth evaluation of public documents from the  University of Campinas that allowed identifying agents of interest, as well as understanding the  organisational profile of the university and in particular, its orientation towards the following:   engaging in regional development processes and fostering inclusiveness; and   building linkages with firms in specific projects related to frugal innovation.
Subsequently, personal interviews were conducted by our research team with four categories  of agents within the organisation, namely, Institutional Representatives, Student Organizations,  Research Centers and Groups and Academic Spin-offs. An additional interview was held with  a large multinational company that has a history of interactions with the University of  Campinas, which offered a complementary perspective from an external stakeholder.
We used snowball sampling to reach individuals of interest in our assessment, starting from  the university’s technology transfer officers. A total of 14 interviews were undertaken in  March, April, and May 2019 (Appendix). All interviews were recorded with the consent of  participants, fully transcribed by two research assistants and analysed by the authors. The  profiles of interviewees are not presented in further detail to respect individuals’ privacy [2].
Although with variations and adaptations, according to interviewees’ categories, the  interview scripts addressed:   Level of institutionalisation of frugal innovation in science and technology transfer activities;   Dynamics of university-business collaborations and potential linkages with frugal innovations;   Strategic technology transfer practices and their potential for promoting frugal  innovations; and   Future challenges concerning further contributions of university-business connections  to the broader socio-economic environment.

The second limitation is related to the theoretical complexity of this phenomenon. A  natural extension of this study should measure the social impact/effectiveness of university/  regional capabilities for frugal innovation. Finally, policies and assessments often mirror  trends observed in the developed world. It is unfortunate, as universities’ connections with  industries in laggard nations could provide more meaningful outcomes if better connected  with the local environment.;;"6. Implications and concluding remarks  This paper analysed the strategic knowledge transfer practices implemented by  entrepreneurial universities for fostering frugal innovations in emerging economies. Building on  a case study of the University of Campinas, we propose a conceptual framework and a set of  theoretical propositions that contribute to the ongoing academic discussions regarding:   the strategic knowledge transfer practices implemented by entrepreneurial universities  in emerging economies (Guerrero et al., 2019a, 2019b); and   the participation of entrepreneurial universities in the generation of frugal innovations to  meet societal challenges (Annala et al., 2018; Chataway et al., 2014; Zeschky et al., 2011).
The study provides relevant implications for the different stakeholders involved in  developing university-business linkages for frugal innovations in emerging economies.
First, universities should strengthen internal ties between members of the academic  community for the joint generation and dissemination of useful knowledge for frugal  innovations. Reducing bureaucratic barriers for interactions with external agents, as well as  setting up incentive schemes that reward involvement with frugal innovation, are critical for  success. Frugal innovation, social innovation and sustainability are emerging activities that  have still not gained full legitimacy within the traditional organizational structures of  universities. Existing incentives tend to prioritize other more traditional activities of  universities’ third missions, such as patent licensing, high-tech spin-offs and income�generating consulting activities. Thus, a cultural shift is necessary to foster the kind of  institutional change that re-aligns academic incentives towards frugal and social  innovations, integrating them into specific policies and strategies throughout the academic  system (Lozano et al., 2015).

Based on six hypoth�eses, the conceptual model is tested through a structural equations model with mediation effects. The  data analysed come from 249 directors of Spanish public university research groups. The results show  that the internal networking formed in university research groups has a positive and signiffcant rela�tionship to knowledge transfer and knowledge absorption, but we obtain different results for the rela�tionship between knowledge transfer and knowledge absorption in the presence of innovation  ambidexterity. Only knowledge absorption has a positive and signiffcant inffuence on innovation  ambidexterity. The most interesting results involve the mediating role of knowledge absorption in the  relationship between internal networking and innovation ambidexterity. These results support the  conclusion that directors of university research groups should promote development of knowledge  absorption processes in order to stimulate innovation ambidexterity and thus to achieve ambidextrous  innovative performance.

KT requires group members to deliver  their knowledge and simultaneously obtain knowledge from the  other members to modify and reuse that knowledge (Chen & Hung,  2010).

We  collected data from groups in all disciplines, as there are no disci�plinary differences in the way these groups are organized, managed  and run. We chose this sample as the unit of analysis for two main  reasons. First, it is important to study the groups’ internal processes;"We validated the measurement model using ML estimation  included in the EQS 6.2 software. The validation consisted of  determining whether the factor loadings for each item were sig�niffcant (t-value>1.96, p < 0.05) and whether their individual  reliability (R2  ) was above the recommended minimum of 0.5. As all  items fulfflled these conditions, we did not have to eliminate any,  and we conffrmed convergent validity of the scales in our study.
Internal consistency was demonstrated by the Cronbach’s alpha  values (Table 2).

Observing group behaviour by scholarly area  would be interesting, as would studying other geographic areas.
Since innovation is the main result of these groups, advances along  these lines would be a positive development.
Second, longitudinal study would have been interesting to  better understand the relationships analysed in the long term.
Third, we examined the criterion of the group’s director only; it  would be interesting to survey all members directly.
Fourth, developing a culture of IA within the group and  encouraging proper, healthy networking that motivates knowledge  management processes is very important. This interesting line of  research could incorporate management of emotional intelligence  into management of research groups and their leaders. Prior  studies show that these issues are determining factors for good  networking and have positive effects on knowledge management  processes in project-related research processes (Decker, Landaeta,  & Kotnour, 2009).

Calcagnini 2015 - The role of universities in the location of innovative start-ups;;;;;;;;;;;;To test our hypothesis, we constructed a database with information on the road and  linear distance between each start-up registered in Italy between 2012 and 2014 and the  university closest to each. A set of variables controlling for ffrm (such as size, legal entity  type, industry) and university characteristics considered (total number of graduates broken;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;We estimate model (1) by means of OLS and quantile regression, and check for possible  spatial autocorrelation as discussed in the following sub-sections.25;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The dependent variable of interest is the geographical distance (km) between start-ups and  the closest university, which has been computed by means of a three-step procedure. First,  we converted start-ups and university addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and  longitude) through the Google Geocoding API process. Then the linear distance (Euclidean  distance) among each start-up and each university was computed and the ffrst three shortest  distances were saved. Third, Google Maps calculated the corresponding street distances  and saved the shortest one.9 A closer examination of Fig. 1 shows that the endogenous  variable Distance is highly skewed. The median distance between a start-up and the closest  university is 5.72 km, while the mean is around three times the median distance,  16.90 km.10;;;;;;;;;;;;;Knowledge transfer ​ Innovative start-up ​ University spillovers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;universities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Firstly, our paper provides an in-depth descriptive analysis of university spillovers and  their relationship with location decisions of innovative start-ups. The cross-correlation  matrix shows that the three different types of university spillovers are positively correlated  with each other and, further, they are also positively correlated with the creation of  innovative ffrms.
Secondly, we estimate a model of ffrms’ locational decisions by means of linear and  quantile regressions. The latter to take into account the skewed spatial distribution of ffrms.
Results suggest that the presence of human capital in terms of graduate students exerts a  signiffcance inffuence on location, being a source for competitiveness for ffrms close to  university. Research quality, especially in the social sciences area (where knowledge is less  codiffed and needs a direct interaction to be transmitted), attracts new ffrms; while the third  mission activities have a weak impact on the locational choice.
";;;;;;;This paper focuses on the role played by universities.;;;;;;;;;;;Our hypothesis is that  geographical proximity favors the transfer of knowledge and technology from universities  to industries and, consequently, represents a positive factor for regional economic devel�opment. ;;;;;;; Effective third�mission engagement also depends on universities continuing to perform at high levels in  relation to their other two missions (research and teachin;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Empirical studies have found evidence that the university contribution to industrial  innovation is larger the higher the quality of academic research is and the closer univer�sities and ffrms are (Mansffeld 1995). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Recent economic literature has shown that different factors affect the geographical prox�imity of ffrms to universites. They can be grouped into three categories: (a) ffrm charac�teristics, such as the sector of activity or ffrm propensity to innovate (see, for instance,  Mansffeld 1995; Muscio 2006), (b) the presence of university spillovers such as knowledge  transfer and human capital (Audretsch et al. 2005), (c) the presence of complementarity or  substitutability between academic research, industry applications and the local industrial  structure (Adams 2002).8";;;;;;;;;;;;;"The second part of Hypothesis 1 is based on the fact that knowledge is either codiffed or tacit.
In the latter case, the transfer of knowledge is more effective in the presence of a tighter spatial  relationship between academic institutions and businesses. In other words, knowledge  transfer, for example in the social sciences, cannot simply be codiffed in a document, but  requires direct contacts between entrepreneurs, researchers and/or graduates. Following  Audretsch et al. (2005) we assume that a proxy for tacit knowledge is the number of grad�uates, which are also a proxy for the size of human capital. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Here we are mostly interested in the role of university spillovers on the location of  innovative start-ups. The theory of localized knowledge spillovers states that ffrms might  choose to locate close to a university to gain access to external knowledge at a cost that is  lower than what they would bear to produce such knowledge internally.;;;;;;;;;Improving on previous research, we explicitly introduce into our analysis a third  mechanism through which universities transfer knowledge to ffrms, the so-called third  mission activities. ;;;;;;;;;;;;"down by ffeld, the share of graduates with residency in the same province where the  university is located, the presence of more than one university in the same province, and  measures related to the 2004–2010 research quality evaluation carried out by the National  Agency for the eValuation of Universities and Research institutes—ANVUR).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The dataset contains observations on variates obtained from several sources. Our depen�dent variable is the start-ups’ location choice, measured as the distance (km) from the  closest university; the latter has been computed by means of a three-step procedure, as  described below.
";;;;;"The independent variables are categorized into three main groups, following Audretsch  et al. (2005). The ffrst group contains variables related to academic research, third-mission  activities and human capital. The second group includes ffrm-speciffc variables, related to  the characteristics of the start-ups. Finally, the third group consists of controls related to the  area where start-ups and the universities are located. Table 1 describes variables used and  data sources.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This paper contributes to the understanding of the role of the collaboration between uni�versities and ffrms. Speciffcally, it analyzes how locational choices of Italian innovative  start-ups are inffuenced by academic institutions’ spillovers. Innovative start-ups are often  invoked by the policy makers as one of the tools available to support innovation and,  therefore, the strengthening of business competitiveness. Indeed, the new Italian legal  framework, the so-called Start-Up Regulation, creates incentives that are aimed at re�moving obstacles and costs for business start-ups; herein incubators are considered one of  the keys for stimulating the labour market and the Italian economy. As long as innovative  start-ups ffnd the proximity to academic institutions favorable for their own business  prospects, the issue of understanding their locational choices is crucial.
";;;;"Link and Scott (2006) showed that the choice of being close to a university translates in a faster growth  than the average. At this stage, our analysis does not consider how distance affects ffrm performance. The  latter will be one of the issues of our future research agenda on knowledge and technology transfers.

This study also had some limitations, which must be taken into account when evaluating  its results. First, the study used a qualitative approach, so its results may not be generalisable  more widely.

Second, the case study was set in a specific context that conditions our concluding  remarks. ";;"Future studies should address how knowledge translation can be achieved.

At the   same evolutionary time, the greater the average cooperation intensity of the nodes are, the deeper the evo�lutionary depth of the knowledge transfer. When the evolutionary time is the same, the evolutionary depth   of knowledge transfer in enterprises is higher than that in university-research institutes. Meanwhile, with   the increase of the network scale, the gap in the depth of knowledge transfer between the two has gradually   increased.
(2) With the relationship between reward and punishment, synergistic innovation income and knowledge   transfer cost together determine the result of the evolution of knowledge transfer in the industry-universi�ty-research cooperation innovation network. Only when the reward, punishment and synergistic innova�tion benefts are higher than the knowledge transfer cost can the benign evolution of the industry-universi�ty-research cooperation innovation network be promoted.
(3) Only when the knowledge transfer coefcient and the knowledge reorganization coefcient exceed a   certain threshold will knowledge transfer behavior emerge in the industry-university-research coopera�tion innovation network. At the same time, with the increase of the knowledge transfer coefcient and the   knowledge reorganization coefcient, the depth of knowledge transfer evolution under various types of   average cooperation intensity is gradually deepening.

";;;"Cultural diplomacy specifies a form of diplomacy that carries a set of  prescriptions which are material to its effectual practice; these prescriptions  include the unequivocal recognition and understanding of foreign cultural  dynamics and observance of the tenets that govern basic dialogue.
";"Diplomacy is the art and practice of conducting negotiations between representa�tives of groups or states. It usually refers to international diplomacy, the conduct of  international relations[1] through the intercession of professional diplomats with  regard to issues of peace-making, trade, war, economics, culture, environment  and human rights. International treaties are usually negotiated by diplomats prior  to endorsement by national politicians. In an informal or social sense, diplomacy  is the employment of tact to gain strategic advantage or to find mutually  acceptable solutions to a common challenge, one set of tools being the phrasing  of statements in a non-confrontational, or polite manner.
";"Economic Diplomacy  Berridge and James (2003) state that “economic diplomacy is concerned  with economic policy questions, including the work of delegations to  conferences sponsored by bodies such as the WTO” and include  “diplomacy which employs economic resources, either as rewards or  sanctions, in pursuit of a particular foreign policy objective” also as a part  of the definition.
Rana (2007) defines economic diplomacy as “the process through which  countries tackle the outside world, to maximize their national gain in all  the fields of activity including trade, investment and other forms of  economically beneficial exchanges, where they enjoy comparative advan�tage; it has bilateral, regional and multilateral dimensions, each of which  is important”.";;;;"Innovation Diplomacy  Science, despite its international characteristics, is no substitute for effective  diplomacy. Any more than diplomatic initiatives necessarily lead to good science.
These seem to have been the broad conclusions to emerge from a three-day  meeting at Wilton Park in Sussex, UK, organised by the British Foreign Office and  the Royal Society, and attended by scientists, government officials and politicians  from 17 countries around the world"; Innovation networks  Innovation networks12 are real and virtual infrastructures and infra-technologies  that serve to nurture creativity, trigger invention, and catalyze innovation in a public  and/or private domain context (for instance, government–university–industry  public–private research and technology development co-opetitive partnerships).13;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The “mode 3” systems approach for knowledge creation, diffusion, and use  “Mode 3” is a multilateral, multi-nodal, multimodal, and multilevel systems  approach to the conceptualization, design, and management of real and virtual,  “knowledge stock” and “knowledge flow,” modalities that catalyze, accelerate,  and support the creation, diffusion, sharing, absorption, and use of co-specialized  knowledge assets. “Mode 3” is based on a system-theoretic perspective of  socioeconomic, political, technological, and cultural trends and conditions that  shape the co-evolution of knowledge with the “knowledge-based and  knowledge-driven, gloCal economy and society.11;;;;;;;Technological innovation is defined here as a situationally new development  through which people extend their control over the environment. ;;;;;;;The concept of the “sectoral systems of innovation” (SSI) crosscuts the logic of  the multilevel systems of innovation or knowledge.

The successful performance of the developed and the developing economies,  societies, and democracies increasingly depends on knowledge. One branch of  knowledge develops along R&D (research and experimental development), science  and technology (S&T) and innovation.25;;;;" Building on these constituent  elements of technology transfer and commercialization, innovation diplomacy  encompasses the concept and practice of bridging distance and other divides  (cultural, socioeconomic, technological, etc.) with focused and properly targeted  initiatives to connect ideas and solutions with markets and investors ready to  appreciate them and nurture them to their full potential.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;In the case of knowledge-referring innovation, we then can speak of innovation  that deals with knowledge. Our impression is that in many contexts, when the focus  falls on innovation, almost automatically this type of “knowledge-referring” or  “knowledge-based” innovation is implied;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Is the linear model of innovation still valid? In an ideal typical understanding, the  linear model states: first there is basic research, carried out in a university context.
Later on, this basic research is converted into applied research, and moves from the  university to the university-related sectors. ";;In  extension of the triple helix model, we suggest a “quadruple helix” model (see  Fig. 2). Quadruple helix, in this context, means to add to the above stated helices a  “fourth helix” that we identify twofold as the “media-based and culture-based  public” as well as the “civil society” (see, furthermore, [43], pp. 206–207) [47, 49,  75].;The Quintuple Helix emphasizes the natural environments of  society, also for the knowledge production and innovation;;;;;;;;;;;;;The “technology life cycles” explain why there is always a dynamic momentum in  the gloCal knowledge economy and society [109]. The “saturation tendency” within  every technology life cycle demands the creation and launch of new technology life  cycles, leading to the market introduction of next-generation technology-based  products and services. In reality, always different technology life cycles with varying  degrees of market maturity will operate in parallel. ;;;;;;The “triple helix” model of knowledge, developed by Henry Etzkowitz and Loet  Leydesdorff [53] (pp. 111–112), stresses three “helices” that intertwine and, by this,  generate a national innovation system: academia/universities, industry, and state/  government. Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff are inclined to speaking of “university–  industry–government relations” and networks, also placing a particular emphasis on  “tri-lateral networks and hybrid organizations” where those helices overlap.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;e would l;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1.

These measurements allow drawing  comparisons between the theory of democracy and the actual behavior and  performance of democracies. Freedom House, as an example, focuses on freedom  as a key dimension of democracy, distinguishing between free, partly free, and not  free countries.32 For Guillermo O’Donnell [92], the interplay of human rights and  human development defines and creates the quality of democracy. The Democracy  Ranking, another democracy measurement initiative, is being theoretically influ�enced by O’Donnell and applies the following conceptual formula for defining the  quality of democracy: “quality of democracy= (freedom+other characteristics of the  political system)+ (performance of the non-political dimensions)” [17] (p. 41).33  Furthermore, the Democracy Ranking distinguishes between the following five  dimensions: politics, gender, economy, knowledge, health, and the environment. To  the dimension of politics, a weight of 50% is being assigned (for the overall ranking  scores); all the other dimensions follow with a weight of 10% [17] (pp. 33–34). With  this focus on performance across a variety of dimensions, the Democracy Ranking  wants to be left/right neutral, as far as possible, not favoring one-sidedly “freedom”  or “equality.” Often, freedom is being associated more closely to conservative (right)  and equality to left ideologies [17] (pp. 31–32; see also [22]). The Democracy  Ranking asserts conceptually a link between the quality of democracy and  “sustainable development” (at least in a mid-term or long-term perspective).
Furthermore, with the specific selection of dimensions for their model of democracy  and the quality of democracy, the Democracy Ranking emphasizes knowledge (and  innovation) and the environment (the natural environments of society). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The “mode 3” systems approach for knowledge creation, diffusion, and use  emphasizes the following key elements [39]:  1. GloCal multilevel knowledge and innovation systems: Because of its compre�hensive flexibility and explanatory power, systems theory is regarded as suitable  for framing knowledge and innovation in the context of multilevel knowledge  and innovation systems [35, 39, 40]. GloCal expresses the simultaneous;;;"There is even more of a tendency that democracy  as well as processes of advancing knowledge and innovation will become  continuously broader, conceptually and in empirical terms [44] (pp. 54–58, 60–  61). We encourage to seeing the creative spectrum of the manifold links and cross�links between innovation, entrepreneurship, and democracy.

";;;;;;;;;;;"H1. Internal environment has an impact on knowledge exploration.
H2. Internal environment has an impact on knowledge exploitation.
";;;;;;;"In the last decades, different conceptual models have been developed in the body of  literature to define the concept of “entrepreneurial university” (Etzkowitz and  Leydesdorff, 1995; Clark, 1998a, b; Sporn, 1999, 2001; Kirby, 2006; O’Shea et al., 2005,  2008; Rothaermel and Hess, 2007; Carayannis and Campbell, 2009; Guerrero and Urbano,  2012; Centobelli et al., 2019).

(2019) to investigate the role of internal and external  environment as antecedents of knowledge exploration and exploitation processes, that in  turn affect university performance. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"2.1 Internal environment, knowledge exploration and exploitation  The enabling internal environment represents a critical success factor for the  entrepreneurial university’s exploration and exploitation processes (Gorman et al., 1997;  Guerrero and Urbano, 2011; Bodunkova and Chernaya, 2012; Urbano and Guerrero, 2013).
Research emphasised that positive and responsive university leadership facilitates the  exploitation and exploration of both existing and new knowledge, skills and processes  (Gibb and Hannon, 2006).

Exploitation boosts university  performance through refining, upgrading and controlling existing skills and practices of the  entrepreneurial university (Kalar and Antoncic, 2015; McClure, 2016) to build capacity for  growth and prevent firm from uncertain environment changes (Louw and Moloi, 2013).
Previous research claimed that exploitation activities improve operation performance and  process efficiency (March, 1991) through learning-curve effects, which minimise mistakes  and transactional costs and foster decision-making implementation and control (Shane,  2000). In addition, it increases the efficiency of capital and assets through improvements in  available technology, capabilities and skills (Rubino and Freshman, 2005). In the same vein,  exploitation develops an entrepreneurial behaviour within students (Bramwell and Wolfe,  2008). Literature highlights that exploitation affects the entrepreneurial firm’s performance  in the short run. However, the effects of exploitation networks are less risky and more  predictable compared with exploration (Louw and Moloi, 2013). These contributions lead us  to hypothesise that (Figure 1):";For the entrepreneurial university, both the exploration and exploitation are important  activities to achieve paramount performance.;;;;;;;;Table I reports the demographic characteristics of the respondents including gender,  working experience and academic background. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In addition, the measurement item’s reliability is assessed evaluating the loadings. Hair  et al. (2010) recommended that the item’s loading should be above 0.50. Table II shows that all  measurement items have significant loading above 0.50, thus met the minimum item’s loading  requirements. Hence, it can be concluded that measurement items are statistically reliable.
4.1.2 Convergent validity. Carmines and Zeller (1979) defined construct validity as  extents to which the items in an instrument measure the abstract or theoretical construct.
According to the scientific literature, three parameters ensure the convergent validity: all  factor loadings weights should be greater than 0.50 (Hair et al., 2006); CR values should be  greater than 0.70; and the average variance extracted (AVE) should be greater than the  measurement error variance for each construct (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Hair et al., 2010).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The findings confirm the higher impact of internal environment on both knowledge  exploitation and knowledge exploration as compared to external environment. Knowledge exploitation  is more strongly related to university performance than knowledge exploration. These results highlight  the imperative role of internal university stakeholders in fostering knowledge management  strategies. In addition, they encourage academicians, practitioners and policy makers to focus their  attention on the impact of knowledge management models, tools and practices in universities to achieve  the entrepreneurial development which, in turn, has a positive impact on individual graduates and  innovation ecosystems.
";;;"This study has limitations that must be acknowledged and overcome in future studies.
Main limitations of this study are related to the sample size and the identification of  respondents. Another limitation of this study regards the way how measures of variables  have been collected. Specifically, in this study, the perception of the respondents has been  used to measure university performance.
";"Finally, this study highlights several areas for future research to extend and generalise  the findings of this analysis, identify specific policies to support the development of  entrepreneurial universities in emerging countries and the potential impact on innovation  ecosystems and civil society. Further studies should focus on the definition of a set of  indices to measure entrepreneurial university performance and evaluate the relationships  with knowledge exploration and exploitation processes. In addition, a comparative study  with entrepreneurial universities operating in other education systems would be a further  interesting area of research for the future. Further, it would be interesting to introduce  university ambidexterity as a construct and further analyse its impact on university  performance. Thus, future contributions should investigate how the university  ambidexterity is achieved over time and how universities oscillate between periods of  exploration and periods of exploitation to achieve synergistic benefits in the university  context and meet both economic and societal needs.
";;;;;"4.1.3 Discriminant validity. Subsequently, discriminant validity of the proposed  framework was assessed to understand that to which extent one construct differ from  other constructs within the model (Churchill, 1979). Hair et al. (2010) describe the following  two parameters to achieve the discriminant validity: maximum shared variance (MSV)  should be lower than AVE; and square root of AVE should be higher than inter-construct  correlations. The values in Table III show good discriminant validity as all MSV are lower  than AVE, and the square root of AVE is higher than inter-construct correlations. Hence,  measurement model is statistically reliable and valid, and there is strong correlation  between the construct and their related items in comparison to the other constructs’ items.
Furthermore, Table IV reports the descriptive analysis.

Cesaroni 2015 - The activities of university knowledge transfer offices;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;In order to analyze the KT activity performed by Italian universities and its evolution over  time, we employed a two-step procedure. As a ffrst step, we made use of a hierarchical  agglomerative clustering technique (Everitt et al. 2011) to identify universities possessing  similar characteristics. This analysis was performed by considering only outcome measures  related to both research and KT activities.;;;;;;;;;;By performing a  cluster analysis and a multinomial logit regression on an extensive dataset that almost  covers the entire population of Italian universities, in this study we analyze (1) whether  models of KT characterized by a broader engagement with society are gradually substi�tuting models more focused on technology commercialization, and (2) which factors re�lated to the availability of resources and universities’ strategic intention better explain  existing differences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Knowledge transfer ​ Knowledge transfer offfces ​ Academic engagement ​  University third mission ​ Entrepreneurial university ​ University–industry collaboration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In this sense, by following the prescriptions of the Resource-Based Theory (Barney  1991; Barney et al. 2011), the shift from the ffrst to the third phase of such an evolutionary  path can be thought of as the consequence of two main conditions: on the one hand, the  deliberate intention pursued by university managers to conceive KT as a means to sti�mulate and support economic dynamics (both locally and nationally); on the other hand,  the endowment of (human, ffnancial and technological) resources and capabilities devoted  to KT, which are able to diffuse a culture of KT in the whole academic institution, to  support researchers in different forms in their effort to create linkages with ffrms, to design  and implement policies that facilitate (and not hinder) KT, and to identify and connect the  different actors external to universities that compose the reference ecosystem.

Moreover, we complemented the analysis of such data with direct  and extensive contacts with university KT managers. Having the possibility to analyze in�depth the population of Italian KTOs, both through quantitative analyses and in-depth  observation, our study thus offers a detailed representation of the heterogeneity of ac�tivities, processes and business models that academic institutions have implemented to  promote KT, and a plausible explanation of the main factors that drive university behavior.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Insights from the study might help university managers to deffne the  most appropriate actions to fully undertake the implementation of the university third  mission.
";;;;"This is why this study aims at offering a  contribution to this debate by addressing the following research questions: (1) which  models of university KTOs are emerging? (2) Are models characterized by a broader  engagement with society gradually substituting models of KT more focused on technology  commercialization? And, (3) which factors related to the availability of resources and  universities’ strategic intention better explain existing differences?
";;;;;;;knowledge transfer (KT) ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"It is worth noting that a slight difference between the concept of academic engagement  and that of knowledge (technology) commercialization does exist (Perkmann et al. 2013),  which also reffects an evolution of the attitudes adopted by university managers. While the  emphasis of knowledge commercialization is on the exploitation of academic research  through formal mechanisms such as patenting, licensing and spin-off creation, in broader  terms academic engagement also embraces both formal and informal mechanisms of KT,  which also include contract research, consulting and networking with ffrms (Perkmann and  Walsh 2008). Academic engagement has thus been deffned as ‘‘knowledge-related col�laboration by academic researchers with non-academic organisations’’ (Perkmann et al.
2013, p. 424), whose pursuit is often driven also by the personal effort of individual  researchers (Link et al. 2007). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A key concept within the ‘‘third mission’’ is the idea that universities should pay greater  attention to aspects related to knowledge generation, application and exploitation, under  the assumption that an efffcient KT process from university to industry and a stricter  cooperation with both the industry and the government may represent an important source  of innovation for ffrms and an engine of economic development for regions and countries  (Perkmann and Walsh 2008). ;;;;;;;;;;;;The two measures are  clearly positively related one with the other, since the likelihood of being involved in  international research projects by having relationship with foreign research teams oper�ating on similar research ffelds and, eventually, by being granted EU-based research funds  increases the higher the impact of past research outcomes.;;;;;;"• STP is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 in the case the university has been  directly involved in (i.e., owned or participated to) a Science & Technology Park  during 2010–2012.
• Incubator is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 in the case the university has  been directly involved in (i.e., owned or participated to) a Business Incubator during  2010–2012.
• Patents measures the total number of new patent applications the university has ffled  during 2010–2012.
• Licenses measures the total number of technology licensing contracts the university  has signed in 2010–2012.
• Contracts measures the total number of contracts the university has signed in  2010–2012 to assign property rights over own technologies to third parties.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;As we will better discuss in the following  section, the three main categories can be thought of as representative of three different  models of academic engagement, which we identiffed with the variable Model. ;;;;;"with the set of coefffcients ai  1 = 0, so that the remaining coefffcients ai  2 and ai  3 would  measure the change relative to the ffrst model of academic engagement.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" In terms of  econometric estimations, we thus expect variables Objective n to be signiffcantly and  positively associated with the variable Model in the multinomial regression model, and  especially Objective 3 (To generate spillovers to the regional economy) and/or Objective  4 (To generate spillovers to the national economy).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"According to the results of the dendrogram obtained through the employed clustering  technique,4 we were able to identify four groups of universities, whose characteristics in  terms of research outcomes and outcomes of KT activities were statistically different  among them. For each of them, Table 4 reports the mean of the different variables that we  used for the analysis, along with the respective standard deviations.
";;To empirically address these research questions we focused on the Italian context and  analyzed the KT activities promoted by (almost) the whole population of Italian univer�sities that currently have active KT policies. Italian universities have started to engage in  KT activities since the 1990s, initially by a few pioneering institutions, and lately by  almost the totality of academic institutions.;;"Furthermore, our analyses suggest that the adoption of a more balanced approach of  academic engagement is also a matter of strategic intention that university managers have  deliberately to pursue towards that goal. In this sense, what emerges from this study is that  only when university managers stop considering KT as a remunerative means of val�orization of research outcomes, the full potential of KT can be exploited. In this, being  latecomers relative to European and US counterparts in promoting KT activities, Italian  universities have certainly beneffted of the example of ffrst-mover institutions, which have  soon realized the inefffcacy of KT as a fund raising mechanism. In fact, academic en�gagement implies that universities perceive themselves as a key actor within the local and  national ecosystem, capable of providing to it relevant knowledge (and human, and  technological) resources, and capable of obtaining from it other (human, ffnancial, rela�tional) resources needed to promote high-quality research. Only in this sense university–  industry KT may become an effective means through which universities contribute to  economic development.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Incentives is an indicator of the existence of speciffc policies promoted by universities  to incentivize faculty/researchers to engage in KT activities. ;;;;;

Two levels of research ambidexterity are elaborated – departmental and individual. The  putative multilevel relationships between university's antecedents, departmental/individual research  ambidexterity and commercial performance are examined. On the basis of a postal questionnaire survey,  a dataset of 634 faculty members, 99 departments, and six universities is collected. The results of re�gressions suggest that both levels of RA facilitate departmental and individual commercial performance,  respectively. Moreover, there exist multilevel positive relationships between perceived organizational  ffexibility, departmental RA, and individual RA and opportunity exploitation. The paper concludes that  the development of RA in entrepreneurial universities should be considered as multilevel relationships  between universities, departments and individuals.
";;;;;;;" this paper analyzes the intra-or�ganizational and multilevel interactions between individuals, de�partments and universities which may jointly inffuence the de�velopment of research ambidexterity in entrepreneurial uni�versities. We argue that there is a need for such a multilevel in�vestigation of universities, departments and individuals in order to  successfully develop the research ambidexterity within academic  institutions.
";;;;;;;;;;;"Hypothesis 1. The greater the department's perception of university  organizational ffexibility, the greater the research ambidexterity of  departments is likely to be.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The goal of theoretical sampling is to choose research targets  that are likely to replicate or extend existing theory (Eisenhardt,  1989). The sampling criterion for this study is focused on uni�versity departments of life, science, engineering, and medical  research, since these ffelds generally have higher potential for  research commercialization. Six major universities in Taiwan  were chosen to reffect the key attributes of universities including  public versus private institutions, and general versus polytechnic  universities. After checking from the researcher database of the  National Science Council (NSC) of Taiwan for data consistency, we  arrived at a total of 2868 survey sample from these six uni�versities. To meet the sampling criterion, this paper required a  valid department to contain at least ffve respondents including  one administrative head/chair/director and four faculty mem�bers. In total, 711 questionnaires were returned, corresponding to  a response rate of 26%. We compared respondents to non-re�spondents in terms of numbers of papers published and patents  granted, and found no statistically signiffcant difference at the  level of po0.05.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Commercialization performance  We assessed the subjective items perceived by department  leaders to constitute departmental-level commercialization per�formance. Referred to Chiesa and Piccaluga (2000) and Jain et al.
(2009), this study developed four questions including: (1) Com�paring same departments in other universities, faculty members in  my department have achieved high performance of research  commercialization. ";"Departmental research ambidexterity  We computed the multiplicative interaction of research pub�lication and commercialization involvement to reffect the RA at the  departmental level. Referred to Shane (2002) and Ambos et al.
(2008),";;;;;Opportunity exploitation  To examine the quantitative attributes of commercialization  performance in individual level, this study employed a number of  objective approaches to investigate individual performance.;" Organizational ffexibility  To convert the organizational ffexibility from the university  level into the department level, alternatively, the paper assessed  the university context of organizational ffexibility which was  perceived by the department leaders as identiffed by Chang et al.
(2009), Clark (2004), and Shimizu and Hitt (2004). "; Individual research ambidexterity  Following Gibson and Birkinshaw (2004) and Jain et al. (2009),  we created an interaction term labeled ‘individual research am�bidexterity’ based on the multiplicative interaction of publication  and commercialization involvement at the individual level.;Opportunity recognition  The current study conceptualized individual antecedent of de�veloping ambidexterity as ‘opportunity recognition’. By referred to  Ambos et al. (2008), we measured by means of four items to reffect  the dimension. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" Control variables  Eight control variables are considered in this study to reffect  university context and individual context. For university context,  the ffrst is a dummy variable denoted as ‘General university’, where a  general university was coded as ‘1’ and a non-general university as  ‘0’ (e.g. Chiesa and Piccaluga, 2000; Meyer-Krahmer and Schmoch,  1998). Prior research has suggested that the ownership of a uni�versity may affect its research performance (Himmelberg et al.,  1999). Thus, a dummy variable was used to denote ‘Ownership’,  where a private university was coded as ‘0’ and a public university  as ‘1’.The third variable denoted ‘Size’, which is calculated in terms  of the number of faculty members in a speciffc department (Ambos  et al., 2008). On the basis of an individual's resource base in terms of  social capital accumulation (Murray, 2004), it is comparatively ea�sier for a senior faculty member to access research resources. A  dummy variable was denoted as ‘Tenure’, which is coded as “1”  when a respondent has worked as a full-time faculty member,  otherwise, “0”. In addition, prior research suggests that researchers  who engage in a scientiffc and technological research ffeld have  more potential to create information asymmetry and hence to ex�ploit knowledge-based resources (Druilhe and Garnsey, 2001). Four  variables are meant to control for the background of faculty  members by using a dummy variable represented as “1” if the fa�culty member worked in Life science, Medicine, Engineering or Sci�ence school; and “0” if he or she did not.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"There are three major ffndings. First, the paper ffnds that both  department and individual levels of RA facilitate each depart�mental and individual commercial performance. This suggests that  the development of research ambidexterity plays a crucial to fa�cilitate organizational commercial performance and individual  opportunity exploitation. Secondly, both department and in�dividual levels of RA are subjected to university-level antecedents.
Organizational ffexibility not only acts as the key antecedent to  foster departmental RA, but also links up with opportunity re�cognition to facilitate individual RA. Thirdly, the paper identiffes  there are multilevel positive relationships between university or�ganizational ffexibility, departmental RA, individual RA and in�dividual opportunity exploitation.
";;Although this paper conffrms that the individual context has a  more powerful inffuence on exploitative commercial performance  than the university context, we should not necessarily expect this  to hold across all countries.

Analysis of Barriers to Collaboration  In view of the ffndings in Section 3.2 that most of the surveyed ffrms prefer not to directly  purchase research results from research institutes/universities, it is necessary to examine  the factors that affect the use of the R&D results. The following main factors have been  identiffed in this study:  . Lack of efffcient communication channel to the research results of research institutes/  universities;  . Unreasonable transfer cost for the research results of R&D institutes and universities;  . Immature technology of the research results of R&D institutes and universities;  . Difffcult to commercialize the research results of R&D institutes and universities;  . Lack of effective service from donor institutions;  . Unclear property rights of the research results;  . No superiority over the same kind of research results abroad;  . Uncertainty of market perspective of the research results.

In this paper,  we explore how MNCs collaborate with universities in the foreign countries where they locate and provide  new empirical evidence for Spain as a host country. Using a probit model with panel data comprising  9,614 ffrms for the period 2005–2011, we explore differences between the propensity to collaborate with  universities of foreign subsidiaries and Spanish ffrms. Subsequently, building on a new survey to 89 for�eign subsidiaries and on a more detailed analysis of ffve case studies, we discuss the variety of motiva�tions that drive collaboration with universities and relate the scale and scope of such collaborations with  the dynamic mandates of foreign subsidiaries in global innovation networks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"5. Conclusions  This paper has contributed both theoretically and empirically to an emerging strand of  research on collaboration between foreign subsidiaries and local universities, providing  new evidence from an intermediate country like Spain. With regard to our ffrst research  question, the econometric study presented in Section 4.1 failed to ffnd signiffcant differ�ences at aggregate level between the propensity to collaborate with universities of for�eign subsidiaries and comparable Spanish ffrms (i.e. those belonging to a group),  controlling for other factors. It was only after estimating the model for individual industries  that we were able to ffnd some relevant differences, pointing to the heterogeneity across  sectors. Building upon this result, future studies could use collaboration with universities  as a proxy for identifying speciffc sectors where the behavior of foreign subsidiaries  tends to be more knowledge-seeking versus those where a knowledge-exploiting strat�egy prevails.
To address our second research objective, we relied mainly on a new survey and a  set of case studies, which were particularly useful to understand the complex motivations  462 J. Guimón & J. C. Salazar-Elena
behind foreign subsidiaries’ collaboration with universities and their evolution over time in  parallel with the sequential upgrading of the subsidiaries’ R&D mandates in global  innovation networks. Despite the limitations of the survey data and the necessary caution  in any attempt to generalize the results from case studies, this part of our research  enabled us to combine our previous results with deeper qualitative insights.
Bringing together the results of the three empirical studies, this paper has revealed  a wide variety of motivations and modes of collaboration, including a combination of  knowledge-seeking and efffciency-seeking strategies. The latter relate to using universi�ties as a conduit for reverse technology transfer in areas where Spain exhibits techno�logical advantages, while the former is associated with the aim to reduce costs and to  access public funding";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Compagnucci 2020 - The Third Mission of the university;;;;;;;;;;;;Stage 1. Formulating research questions and search terms. In order   to define the boundaries of the subject, as well as desk research, experts   in the area of TM (namely Rector delegates, scholars and knowledge   transfer office staff) were also consulted. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The methodology used for this SLR is described below. 
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Co-creation   Entrepreneurial university   Innovation   Knowledge transfer   Third Mission   University-industry ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"On the other hand, according to a wide range of studies of the ‘en�trepreneurial university’ (see Section 3.2) (e.g. Etzkowitz, 1983;   Rothaermel et al., 2007; Etzkowitz et al., 2008; Foss and Gibson, 2015), a   TM represents the gradual shifting of universities towards economic-based,   or inspired, activities in the sense of commercialising knowledge   (Günther and Wagner, 2008). A TM refers to the activities and the assets of   an entrepreneurial university, one which links research to the commer�cialisation of technological and innovative outcomes (Rothaermel et al.,   2007; Van Looy et al., 2011; Shore and McLauchlan, 2012). This means   that TM activities are those visible initiatives, that deeply affect the aca�demic ethos (Montesinos et al., 2008; Aragonés-Beltrán et al., 2017; de la   Torre et al., 2018), and involve economic actors so as to create and   strengthen partnerships (Kotosz et al., 2016). 
";"The definition of the entrepreneurial university   The entrepreneurial university has attracted considerable attention   from scholars and policy makers (e.g. Clark, 1998a; Etzkowitz and   Leydesdorff, 2000; Gibb, 2005; Kirby, 2006; O'Shea et al., 2007;   Rothaermel et al., 2007; Nelles and Vorley, 2010a; Guerrero and   Urbano, 2012). As noted by Salamzadeh et al. (2016), some studies   have stated that the entrepreneurial university is a universal phenom�enon with an isomorphic developmental path. For example, Dill (1999)   referred to an entrepreneurial university as ‘university technology   transfer’ and Ropke and Xia (1998) consider the entrepreneurial uni�versity to be an ‘entrepreneur organisation’.";;;;;;" The entrepreneurial shift in higher education   The increasing need to produce, transfer, and commercially exploit   viable research findings has progressively led universities to rethink   and adjust their role (Goethner and Wyrwich, 2019) within the local,   national, and international contexts they belong to. This turnaround   within higher education was first investigated by Etzkowitz (1983),   who first coined the term ‘entrepreneurial university’ to describe uni�versities as institutions that have become crucial for regional economic   development. Many and various studies have since highlighted that the   entrepreneurial university is a model of the TM which prioritizes a set   of activities, based on the combination of academic and business im�peratives, by broadening both the inputs to academic knowledge and its   use in an economic and societal context (Clark, 1998a, 1998b;   Etzkowitz, 2003b; Rothaermel et al., 2007; Etzkowitz et al., 2008;   Vorley and Nelles, 2009; Trencher et al., 2014; Foss and Gibson, 2015). 
Furthermore, these activities rely on research and a new management   paradigm for the provision of universities’ tasks (Unger and Polt, 2017). 
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Knowledge transfer as a function of the Third Mission   The TM promotes the active engagement of universities in KT ac�tivities, which are an important source of innovation and an engine of   economic development for regions (Perkmann and Walsh, 2008; ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" The paper offers both a descriptive and a thematic analysis, through   examination of 134 peer-reviewed articles which were published between 2004 and May 2019. 
";;;;The methodology adopted in this paper is that of a systematic lit�erature review of double-blind peer-reviewed academic articles which   focus on the TM of universities. From a general point of view, an SLR   establishes the state of current knowledge in a given field   (Tranfield et al., 2003).;;;;;;;;;;;;The paper reveals   the potential and the constraints of the recurring themes of the TM, focusing especially on the engagement of   non-academic stakeholders. It also suggests, to scholars and policymakers, a selection of measures through which   some of the challenges might be faced;;;;;;;;;;;" To this end, this   paper addresses the following research questions:   1) What are the key constraints in the recurring themes of the TM? 
2) What measures might be able to support policy making and the   enactment of the TM?";;;;;;;Implicit in the concept of the TM, there have, historically, been both a first;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The Third Mission of universities: an evolving concept   Many unprecedented challenges, such as the knowledge economy, glo�balisation, the financial, and the environmental crises, are contributing   significantly to redesigning and extending the missions of universities   (Trencher et al., 2014; El Hadidi and Kirby, 2016; Rubens et al., 2017). 
Implicit in the concept of the TM, there have, historically, been both a first ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Furthermore,   the diverse meanings that different scholars attach to TM reflect their   diverse visions of higher education. For example, expressions like ‘third   stream’ of HEIs (Laredo, 2007), ‘technology transfer’ (Hackett and   Dilts, 2004), ‘university-business cooperation’ (Adamsone-Fiskovica et al.,   2009), ‘community engagement’ (Jongbloed et al., 2008) ‘public en�gagement’, ‘service mission’ and ‘community service’ are usually used as if   they were synonymous with the TM (Vargiu, 2014). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The expression TM is rather nebulous (Gregersen et al., 2009) and   ambiguous (Laredo, 2007; Pinheiro et al., 2015a). On the one hand,   from a general point of view, it consists of wide-ranging and recurring   concepts such as the ‘entrepreneurial university’, ‘technology transfer’   and ‘Triple Helix Model (THM) partnerships’ (Trencher et al., 2014).";;;;;;;;;;;;Stage 2. Database search. Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS),   Elsevier's Scopus, and Google Scholar, were the three main sources for   bibliometric data. ;;;;;;The paths taken by the entrepreneurial university: constraints and   potentials   The literature has also suggested some pathways and potentials for the   development of the entrepreneurial university and has emphasised those   theoretical and practical constraints which may, or should be, taken into   account by academia and policy makers when designing the en�trepreneurial university. For instance, Clark (1998a) attempted to identify   and explain the processes and methods by which an entrepreneurial   university can be created. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" Entrepreneurship education   KTOs also facilitate interaction between academia and industries by   promoting the diffusion of entrepreneurship education and culture amongst   students and university staff. Thus, within a TM, entrepreneurship educa�tion is strictly linked to local developments, especially in terms of con�tributing to developing human capital (Arbo and Benneworth, 2007;   Jäger and Kopper, 2013; Šmídová et al., 2017). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"A table has been drawn up for each of the recurring themes in   order to suggest a selection of measures which might be able to support   an innovative framework for both policy intervention and for the en�actment of the TM of universities. 
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This SLR does have some limitations, including the level of accu�racy. To tackle this, the analysis started broadly and then focused on the   recurring themes of the TM, revealing their interconnections as un�deniable dimensions of the TM, which is a highly complex and still   evolving phenomenon. ;;This paper proposes themes which require further investigation in   order to advance both the understanding and the enactment of the TM as   well as its contribution to society at large. Some unsolved challenges or   promising areas, which require further research could be the following.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Cruz 2020 - Changing times at cuban universities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;retrospective case study perspective of the transition of Cuban universities into a social, innovative,  and entrepreneurial organization. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;By adopting  the theoretical bases of entrepreneurial universities [4,6], social entrepreneurship [19], and business  model innovation literature [20,21], we propose a conceptual model to analyze the transition of socialist  universities into a social, innovative, and entrepreneurial organization;" Understanding the Business Model Innovation of Socialist Universities  According to Zott and Amit [20] (p. 110), business model innovation is understood as the way in  which an organization ""does business"" with its clients, partners and suppliers. In other words, it is a  system of activities that are developed by the focal organization, and its partners carry out to meet  the perceived technological needs in the market. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"higher education system; social entrepreneurship; entrepreneurial universities; business  model innovation; innovation ecosystem; socialist economies; Cuba";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Despite the lack of consensus, an entrepreneurial and innovative university is generally understood  as a natural incubator that provides an adequate environment to support the entrepreneurial  and innovative initiatives developed for the university community (i.e., students, academics,  staff, alumni) [6–8,10]. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;We revised and tested this model in the context of Cuban universities by implementing a  prospective case study approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; This study  provides a better understanding of the entrepreneurial and innovative transition of universities  located in socialist economies. ;;;;;;;;;;;"Concretely, how have universities located in socialist economies have been transforming themselves  into social, innovative, and entrepreneurial organizations? How have university managers transitioned  into innovative business models? How have universities located in socialist economies been impacting  on the regional innovation system? How effective have the pro-market state regulations been?
";;;;;;;"For instance, the  transformation process has been motivated by the fostering of entrepreneurial initiatives through  spin-offs/start-ups and technology-based ventures [10]; as well as innovative initiatives through the  transference of knowledge or technologies to the productive sectors via licenses, patents, inventions,  and intellectual property rights [1].
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;At the internal level, the existence of knowledge transfer  infrastructures that support knowledge management is favorable to this transformation [2]. However,  the lack of an entrepreneurial culture and favorable attitudes towards entrepreneurship represents  another barrier in the transformation process [11]. It is explained by the lack of understanding of the  university community about the meaning and signiffcance of entrepreneurial initiatives [15].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The data collection process adopted the triangulation approach suggested by Yin [23]. This  approach consists of combining diverse sources of information to gather data about the studied  phenomenon. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Our ffndings show insights about the transition towards a business  model innovation within Cuban universities. ;;;"This research has several limitations. The ffrst limitation has been the lack of evidence about the  impacts of each identity of Cuban universities in terms of wellbeing, technological transformation,  and economic development. Future research should explore the impacts generated by each university  identity: social, innovative, and entrepreneurial. It demands longitudinal and in-depth studies [35].
The second limitation is the lack of evidence about the link with stakeholders. Our interviews  provide insights about the contribution of Cuban universities to the productive sector. However, the  stakeholder’s perspective should be included in the future research agenda [10,34]. The third limitation  is the lack of evidence about the effectiveness of the Cuban State policies. Although the strategy  was designed to improve the country’s competitiveness, there is no evidence about the achievement  of the expected outcomes [18,47,48]. The fourth limitation is associated with the metrics used in  our semi-structured interviews. Future research should consider the implementation of quantitative  metrics that allow understanding of interviewees’ perceptions as well as explore causal relationships.

Our ffndings suggest policy  tradeoffs for multi-university collaborations. On the one  hand, long-term innovation, which we could not mea�sure, may be improved by having universities collaborate  with other institutions that can offer expertise the single  university cannot develop locally. Perhaps the type of  expertise is too scarce to develop locally, is too expen�sive, or would not improve the competitive advantage  of the institution. In the short-term, however, multi�university projects were signiffcantly less successful than  projects performed by one university. I;;"Though we have data on a large number of research  collaborations, there are a few signiffcant issues we did  not consider. First, we focused on short-term outcomes  in research collaboration, rather than the quality of a  particular outcome or long-term outcomes. For exam�ple, we asked respondents whether or not they published  articles based on the research, but we did not collect data  on their number of articles or citations. We also exam�ined only outcomes directly related to the collaborations  and not the other opportunities foregone by participating  in these collaborations. It is possible that having multi�ple universities in a project has a different impact on the  quality of research or long-term outcomes (although we  speculate that short-term and long-term outcomes, and  quality, are likely related). Second, in addition to multi�ple universities, there are other factors that inffuence the  success of research, including funding agency structures  and university tenure processes that favor disciplinary  work (Metzger and Zare, 1999). We do not have informa�tion about what led investigators to seek out funding from  the NSF ITR program, and what the opportunity costs  were of doing so across disciplinary and organizational  boundaries. Future work would benefft greatly from  understanding the longer term consequences of multi�university collaborations and the decision processes that  underlie engaging in multi-university collaborations.

The directors were affiliated   with different universities in Spain (Universidad de Sevilla, Universidad de Extremadura,   Universidad de las Palmas, Universidad de Granada and Universidad de Cantabria) and   different disciplines (Social Sciences, Experimental Sciences, Humanities, Health Sciences and   Technology). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Internal networking; innovation ambidexterity, knowledge transfer; knowledge   absorption; university research.

H6: KA mediates the relationship between internal networking and IA.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;"Ambidexterity is the capability of performing basic functions while simultaneously developing   other functions different from the basic ones in order to improve performance (Cao et al., 2009;   Raisch et al., 2009; Sengupta & Ray, 2017). In the context of our study, ambidexterity means   that university research groups must be able to develop capabilities and incorporate processes   that foster and improve activities related to exploitation of knowledge, while simultaneously   creating new knowledge—exploration (Sengupta & Ray, 2017). ";;;;;;;;"KT is defined as the process by which a unit, group, department or division is affected by the   experience of others (Argote & Ingram, 2000), both within a group or department and among   departments or different levels in the organizational hierarchy (Bhatt, 2001; Szulanski, 1996). 
KT requires group members to deliver their knowledge and simultaneously obtain knowledge   from the other members to modify and reuse that knowledge (Chen & Hung, 2010).
In this context, KT is performed within the work group, based on the research on which the   members collaborate (García-Sanchez et al., 2019). To achieve KT, internal research networks   are formed to foster better communication and closer connections among researchers, as these   networks enable easier and more frequent KT (Ming-Chao et al., 2018; García-Sanchez et al.,   2019) and prevent researchers from working alone (De Saá-Pérez et al., 2017). These actions   encourage KT because researchers who work in internal networks are more sensitive to   transferring knowledge due to the constant interaction within the networks (Armbrecht et al.,   2001).";;"KA is “a dynamic capability pertaining to knowledge creation and utilization that enhances   ability to gain and sustain a competitive advantage” (Zahra & George, 2002, p. 185). KA is   defined as a set of organizational routines and strategic processes through which knowledge is   acquired, assimilated, transformed and applied in order to create a dynamic capability (Zahra   & George, 2002, p. 2). KA has become one of the most important constructs in recent decades,   due to the importance of recognizing the value of new knowledge, as well as the capability to   assimilate and use new knowledge to develop improvements (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990;   Cordero & Ferreira, 2019). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Internal networking is defined as the real set of all connections and the frequency   of interaction and communication that occur internally within a group of individuals (Mitchell,   1973). Knowledge management—and by extension its processes (KA and KT)—is a driver that   research groups can use to generate IA (Lin et al., 2013). As a whole, the main objective of this   paper is to analyse the mediating role of KT and KA in the relationship between the internal   networking created in public university research groups and IA.;;"Knowledge management processes are defined as fundamental actions that an organization   performs to process and manage its knowledge resources (Holsapple & Joshi, 2000). These   processes play an essential role in the framework of knowledge management theory, since they   provide information on the main tasks and actions to be performed to manage an organization’s   knowledge resources efficiently (Al Ahbabi et al., 2019). Knowledge management processes   include KT and KA. These processes are significant to study of knowledge management   (McAdam & Reid, 2000) because they provide the organization with the individual’s   knowledge and transform that individual knowledge into collective knowledge—a process that   continues to be a fundamental challenge. 
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Our analysis leads us to conclude that the relationship between   internal networking and IA in university research groups is not as simple as it seems (in direct   relationships, only one relationship is considered (Cao et al., 2009) and that other (mediating)   variables complicate this relationship;;;;;;;"We obtained 249 valid questionnaires, giving a response rate of 8.3%. As the response rate was   relatively low, we tested for nonresponse bias through an ANOVA and found no statistically   significant differences between respondents and non-respondents in terms of demographic   variables. It is important to consider that surveys addressed only to the directors generally   produce much lower response rates (Gielnik et al., 2012; Zacher & Rosing, 2015). 
Groups in the sample generally had 5-10 researchers, representing 50% of the total, while 37%   of the groups had over 10 researchers, and only 13% had fewer than 5. Significantly, Johnston   (1994) affirms that the minimum group size for a group to compete internationally is 4-6   members. 
";;;;;;Interactions among these groups’ internal networks   constitute an increasingly frequent way to organize work (Chen et al., 2012) and to achieve   better use of knowledge, be more effective and perform more creative tasks (Wu et al., 2009)—  all actions that benefit KT. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The relationship between KA and IA is positive and significant, however, permitting   acceptance of H4. Studying the effects of KA on IA, Jansen et al., (2005) and Limaj &   Bernroider (2017) conclude that, although they find a relationship between the variables, there   is still much to be learned about them and more in-depth research is needed on the study context. 
Our study responds to these calls by contributing to development of this literature in a specific   context. ";;"First, it would be interesting to study other antecedents that facilitate KT and KA in research   groups, as well as their possible effects on groups’ IA. Observing group behaviour by scholarly   area would be interesting, as would studying other geographic areas. Since innovation is the   main result of these groups, advances along these lines would be a positive development. 
Second, longitudinal study would have been interesting to better understand the relationships   analysed in the long term. Third, we examined the criterion of the group’s director only; it   would be interesting to survey all members directly. 
Fourth, developing a culture of IA within the group and encouraging proper, healthy networking   that motivates knowledge management processes is very important. This interesting line of   research could incorporate management of emotional intelligence into management of research   groups and their leaders.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Dalamarco 2019 - New perspectives on university industry relations;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;he research con�sisted of multiple case studies. The case study method makes it possible to examine a phenomenon  in its real-life context (Yin 2013) and allows a more ffexible analysis of the results (Hair et al. 201;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Knowledge Flow; University�Industry Relations; Triple  Helix; Brazil; Netherlands";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"However, these studies do not refer explicitly to the content of the knowledge being transferred,  nor do they indicate which actor is responsible for starting the interaction. Even though some articles  provided analysis of a certain knowledge ffow, it has focused mostly on the characteristics of the  knowledge ffow in industrial partnerships (Chen et al. 2018), and on different TT channels (Lee  et al. 2016). Analysis of the actors involved rarely goes beyond describing their role and the channels  used to transfer the knowledge in question. In other words, ‘knowledge ffow’ as an analysis of the  content of knowledge (basic or applied) transferred in UIR is still missing from the ongoing debate.
";;;;;;;;;;;"These considerations lead to the following research question: How does the knowledge ffow  in university-industry relations differ in various innovation systems (in terms of its direction and content)?
";;;;;;;Within this context, the term knowledge ffow is deffned by two aspects: direction and content. Direc�tion is deffned by the actor responsible for proposing the interaction – either the university or the  company – or by stimuli from the government. The actor responsible will then deffne the content  of the knowledge, i.e. technology output, intended to result from the partnership, and this could  be either a new technology based on fundamental research or a combination of existing technol�ogies;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The relationships in UIR depend on the scientiffc and technological context described by the coun�try’s national innovation system (Nelson and Rosenberg 1993). National Innovation Systems are  shaped by factors such as its stage of development and by scientiffc and technological capabilities  (Carlsson et al. 2002; Lundvall 2007).
From a different perspective, Malerba (2004) discusses the importance of sectoral innovation  systems. According to Malerba (2004), the national approach underestimates the power of private  actors, i.e. ffrms, and the role of intra-sector dynamics. The most important element in a sectoral inno�vation system is knowledge transfer, which is related to the technological level of ffrms, the scientiffc  activity at universities, and government policies and initiatives (Fontana, Geuna, and Matt 2006).
In the world of UIR, the concept of the Triple Helix has been introduced to refer to the expanding  role of corporate actors, the proactive behaviour of universities, supportive governments and their  mutual collaborations (Etzkowitz 2008). Universities are primarily responsible for creating basic  knowledge (Nelson 2006), but they can also engage in entrepreneurial activities such as supporting  the creation of start-ups (Etzkowitz 2008).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Based on the concept  and practice of knowledge ffow, this paper presents a deeper analysis of UIR in two countries,  Brazil and the Netherlands, and in two sectors, agriculture and aerospace;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;. This includes universities, which have been engaged in entre�preneurial activities through technology transfer (TT) and innovation (Etzkowitz et al. 2008). ;;;;;"University–industry relations  University-Industry relations consist of a knowledge creation actor (university) and an actor respon�sible for applying that knowledge to technology and innovation (industry) (Dosi, Llerena, and Labini  2006). In order to generate effective knowledge ffows between universities and industry, it is necess�ary to establish continuous relationships such as long-term projects. These relations are also fostered  by government agencies through regulatory laws, organisation of clusters, education and research  incentives (Lundvall 2007).
";;;;;;;;;To examine the knowledge ffow in UIR, we conducted a comparative case study in two different  countries involving two of their sectors with speciffc technology levels. Given their differences in  terms of socioeconomic development, a closer examination of two countries into some of their  leading industries, allows us to observe different aspects of the knowledge ffow.;;;;;;"The interviews were conducted using open-ended questionnaires (Jackson and Trochim 2002)  and divided into three main categories: institution proffle, sector proffle (questions based on  Malerba 2004; Fontana, Geuna, and Matt 2006; Lundvall 2007; De Fuentes and Dutrenit 2012), and  knowledge ffow (questions based on the literature review presented in Table 1). Two questionnaires  were designed, one for companies and one for universities and research centres. We categorised the  results using content analysis, which provided a systematic description that enhanced our under�standing of the results. The four types of technology output were based on categories deffned  during the literature review. All interviews were transcribed, analysed using MaxQDA v.11, which  also allowed the organisation of the digital reports used.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"To summarise the various factors discusses above, we developed an analytical framework based  on the type of content, i.e. technology output, being transferred through the knowledge ffow  (Table 1). The framework was initially inspired by the framework developed by Stokes (1997) and  is complemented by the concepts presented by Perkmann and Walsh (2009) and (Mankins 2009).
As such, the actor initiating the interaction deffnes the knowledge content (i.e. the type of technology  output) based on both its technological level and the purpose of the interaction.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The main contribution of this article is to provide new insights into the dynamics of sectoral and  national innovation systems, and how these are linked to the knowledge ffow of individual UIR.
While the technological trajectory of a certain sector could be the initial reference point for the knowl�edge ffow in UIR, sectoral and national differences led to differences in the pattern of knowledge ffow.
";;The main limitation of our analysis was that there was no real discussion of the tacit and explicit  knowledge involved in the knowledge ffow, even though this could have improved our understand�ing of what type of knowledge was being transferred’. Another limitation is that we did not analyze  the knowledge ffow in speciffc R&D projects. As such, an interesting avenue for future research would  be to analyze the knowledge ffow in product development, looking carefully at the type of knowl�edge involved (tacit or explicit), the technology readiness and its relevance to the company’s inno�vation strategy. ;;"As such, an interesting avenue for future research would  be to analyze the knowledge ffow in product development, looking carefully at the type of knowl�edge involved (tacit or explicit), the technology readiness and its relevance to the company’s inno�vation strategy. This may provide valuable new insights into strategies for R&D portfolio and  innovation management. In addition, the level of trust between different partners and the  inffuence of trust on the type of knowledge ffow could also be examined. It would also be interesting  to expand the analysis to a third sector (aeronautics, for example, which is strong in Brazil and weak in  the Netherlands) and to a medium-sized country (like France or Spain), analyzing the differences in  sectoral and national innovation systems.

Indeed,  the shift of the governance model of the cultural sector from a “micro” perspective to a “meso”  perspective, involving multiple partners and stakeholders, seems to manage better with the  traditional reliance of the sector on public funding and private sponsorships (Bonet and  Donato, 2011; Borin et al., 2018) and with the new opportunities offered by regional projects of  culture-led regeneration and development (Sacco and Tavano Blessi, 2009; Petrova, 2018).
Accordingly, the comprehension of knowledge flow mechanisms inside the local ecosystems  is crucial in developing its potential.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"While scrutinising the literature, we found it useful to look for thoughts and concepts in two  different streams of research:  (1) First, we underlined the main features of the flow of knowledge within a cultural  ecosystem, and highlighted the main differences concerning knowledge transfer in  the mainstream literature.
(2) Second, we recalled the concept of the entrepreneurial university as a collective  intelligent system because we deem that it is useful to elicit the aptitude of such an  organisation to act as a cultural mediator and knowledge catalyst in a cultural  ecosystem. In so doing, we highlighted the knowledge translation processes that  universities can leverage on to foster cultural entrepreneurship.

Hence, further work will address two main concerns. First is the examination of the  environmental factors that can favour or constrain the institutionalisation of the model  experimented through the pilot project within the university. The second regards the  evaluation of the replicability of the project because “one swallow does not make a summer”;  the pilot project should be communicated, participatory and especially replicated thanks to a  protocol that is able to reproduce the experience in different cities, urban areas and  neighbourhoods, to multiply the positive impacts.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the UITT process and its outcomes. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Technology transfer is usually thought of as occurring within or across firms, such as the  dissemination of information through transfers of employees from one division or country to  another (intra-firm transfers of technology). Indeed, much research has focused specifically  on the flow of technology transfer within a large R&D organization, or from an R&D subunit  to the larger organization (Allen, 1984). In this paper, we focus instead on the UITT process,  or commercial transfers of scientific knowledge from universities to firms.
We contend that the key stakeholders in UITT are: (1) university scientists, who discover  new technologies, (2) university technology managers and administrators, who serve as  liaisons between academic scientists and industry and manage the university’s intellectual  property, and (3) firms/entrepreneurs, who commercialize university-based technologies. This  is by no means an exhaustive list of stakeholders. For example, the federal government,  which funds most of these research projects, can also be viewed as a stakeholder.

universities wishing to foster commercialization need to be mindful of the following  organizational and managerial factors:   eradicating cultural and informational barriers that impede the UITT process   designing flexible university policies on technology transfer   improving staffing practices in the TTO   devoting additional resources to UITT, if that is consistent with the university’s mission   enhancing the rewards for engaging in UITT   encouraging informal relationships and social networks  More generally, our results imply that universities should consider UITT from a strategic  perspective. This implies that they must address a set of formulation and implementation  issues. We have already noted the critical implementation issues (e.g., changes in HRM and  other organizational practices). The key formulation issues are setting institutional goals and  priorities for UITT and the related issue of determining the appropriate level of resources to  devote to UITT. These choices will affect decisions regarding the set of technologies (e.g.,  biotechnology) and modes of UITT to stress, i.e., licensing, start-ups, sponsored research, or  other UITT mechanisms that are focused directly on stimulating economic development (e.g.,  science parks).
We have also identified some measures that firms can adopt to facilitate UITT. These  include being proactive in their efforts to bridge the cultural gap with academia through  frequent meetings and workshops with universities, hiring technology managers who know  how to work with universities, and using the labor market to tap into UITT social networks.
US universities have long been known for their scientific breakthroughs and knowledge  generation. Only through cooperative efforts with the private sector can the end result of  successful commercialization materialize. It is ultimately the responsibility of both univer�sities and firms to ensure such cooperation.
Although we have argued that there should be ‘‘thinner’’ boundaries between universities  and firms, there are some potential problems associated with such initiatives that need to be  acknowledged";;;;Commercial knowledge transfers from universities  to firms: improving the effectiveness of  university–industry collaboration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The scheme focuses on bringing beneffts to both industry and academic  institutions through knowledge transfer between the three partners.
The main objectives of the scheme, as stated by the offfcial KTP web site (KTP, 2010), are to:  B Facilitate the transfer of knowledge and the spread of technical and business skills,  through innovation projects undertaken by high calibre, recently qualiffed, people under  the joint supervision of personnel from business and the knowledge base.
B Provide company-based training for graduates in order to enhance their business and  specialist skills within the context of the project.
B Stimulate and enhancing business relevant education and research undertaken by the  knowledge base.
B Increase the extent of interactions by businesses with the knowledge base and their  awareness of the contribution the knowledge base can make to business development  and growth.
The KTP scheme is structured to promote collaborative interaction in which the three  partners work together to reach the objectives of a speciffc business project. The central  component of a KTP is the associate partner who is employed by the university and spends  10 per cent of their time on formal training and 90 per cent of their time based in the  company. As a result, the associate acts as the human bridge linking the academic and the  industrial partners (Tiler and Gibbons, 1991)";;;;;;;;;;of practice’’. Relationships and social interaction are seen as central to knowledge and  learning in communities that coalesce around speciffc practices. Participation in the  community, initially as a legitimate peripheral participant, gives members access through  learning to the community’s knowledge resources as well as the ability to participate in the  negotiation of meaning within the community;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The acquisition of tacit knowledge must then be seen as a process of learning. Academic  partners need to share some of this tacit knowledge to participate in collaborative research:  more intense forms of collaboration, especially those with exchanges of staff, will have a  higher tacit component. Studies related to this type of university-industry knowledge transfer  include those considering the implication of university-industry research/linkages  (Blumenthal et al., 1986; Mueller, 2006; Este and Patel, 2007; Arvanitis et al., 2008) and  those comparing the UK’s Teaching Company Scheme (TCS) with other technology transfer  schemes (Acworth, 2008; Burvill and Leary, 2001).

Moreover,  the analysis highlights the signiffcance of the boundary spanning roles of the KTP partners in facilitating  the knowledge transfer process through engagement in both the university and industry communities.;;"By illuminating the dimensions of the inter-personal interactions  involved in the knowledge transfer process the CoPs analysis provides the foundations for  recommendations to improve university-industry KTPs, in particular, and, inter-organisational  knowledge transfer initiatives in general. A limitation of this research is its focus on the UK context.
";;"Further research is required to develop a deeper appreciation of the role of  boundary processes including brokers, boundary objects, joint projects and other boundary  interactions in facilitating the transfer of knowledge.

Hierarchical linear regression was used to  test the hypotheses while partial least squares structural equation modelling was used for post hoc analysis.;;"– Intellectual capital (IC) has been suggested to be a means by which firms develop capabilities that  enhance competitive advantage. There is, however, a paucity of empirical research linking IC with innovation  in construction firms, leaving the IC–innovation link in such environments unclear. The purpose of this paper  is to advance understanding of the relationships between IC components and strategic exploratory and  exploitative innovation in construction contractor firms.
";;;;;;;;;;;"H1a. HC will be positively related to exploratory innovation.
";;;;;;;A focus on the interaction  of exploration and exploitation (e.g. Kostopoulos et al., 2015) also fails to explain how IC  dimensions affect the two kinds of innovation processes individually when firms pursue  contextual solutions. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; For instance, Kostopoulos et al. (2015) examined ambidextrous  learning as a mediator in the IC-performance relationship in units while Kang et al. (2012)  earlier explored IC sub-dimensions as mediators in an HRM-learning framework in teams;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Consistent with the knowledge-based view (KBV) (Grant, 1996) and rooted in the  resource-based view (RBV) (Barney, 1991) firms need to create or accumulate knowledge and  leverage such knowledge for exploratory and exploitative activities. Knowledge in firms is  considered to be inherent in individuals (human capital (HC)), networks and relationships  (social capital (SC)) and in structures, systems, routines, databases (organisational capital  (OC)). Researchers have referred to these forms of knowledge as the components of a firm’s  intellectual capital (IC) (Martín-de-Castro et al., 2011; Youndt et al., 2004).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" Intellectual capital  IC of the firm is described as the sum of all the knowledge a firm uses to gain competitive  advantage (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998; Subramaniam and Youndt, 2005). Despite the  existence of different conceptualisations of the components of IC, there is some consensus  regarding the key components of IC of a firm as being HC, SC and OC (Youndt et al., 2004;  Subramaniam and Youndt, 2005; Kang and Snell, 2009).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The study sample is drawn from a population of construction contractor firms registered  with the Development Bureau of Hong Kong. It included mainly medium and large  contractors employing 50 or more persons. Such firms are not only the likely sources but are  also adopters of innovations that enhance the construction process (Miozzo and Dewick,  2002). Again, these firms are more likely to have the resources and also be involved in large  and complex projects or portfolio of projects that require exploration and exploitation for  successful delivery (cf. Chan et al., 2014).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Exploratory innovation;;;;;Firm siz;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Innovation was measured with ten items, five items for each of exploratory and exploitative  innovation, on a five-point Likert scale (1 ¼ strongly disagree, and 5 ¼ strongly agree). Items  were adapted from the exploratory and exploitative innovation scales developed by Jansen  et al. (2006) and Kang et al. (2012). IC was measured with 14 items: 3 items for OC, 6-items for  SC and 5-items for HC. Items were adapted from the IC scale developed by Youndt et al.
(2004) and used by Subramaniam and Youndt (2005). Firm size has been recognised to affect  innovation (e.g. Bierly et al., 2009; Jansen et al., 2006; Subramaniam and Youndt, 2005).
Therefore, firm size was used as a control variable and measured by giving respondents a  choice from categories of number ranges that best approximate to the number of employees  in their organisation.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Social capital (SC) and organisational capital (OC) each have significant positive linear effects on  exploratory and exploitative innovation, while human capital (HC) has no direct linear effect on either  innovation type. HC, however, affects both exploratory and exploitative innovation through SC or OC. None of  the three IC dimensions has a significant quadratic effect on exploratory or exploitative innovation. The  findings suggest that in construction contractor firms increases in the accumulation of SC and OC are  associated with proportional increases in exploratory and exploitative innovation.
";;The study has highlighted the relationships between IC components and construction contractor  firms’ strategic exploratory and exploitative innovation. Notwithstanding the insights presented  by the findings, some limitations are worth mentioning, which provide avenues for future  research. ;;"Future research can explore the relationships between IC and  innovation in multiple types of project-based firms or different types of construction firms to  allow for comparisons among the different firms regarding the effect of IC on exploratory and  exploitative innovation or between project-based and non-project-based firms to give a broader  understanding of the relationships across contexts and industries.

This model focuses on the process aspect of collaboration and   on cause-effect relationship in collaboration, consisting of inception,   planning, operational, and transition phases. However, this is a theo�retical model not describing the use of the model in context. Unlike these   models, the model presented in this paper is a practical collaboration   model, derived from our eight-year experience of running a collabora�tive research project with the SE industry. The work that is closest to   ours is the model for technology transfer introduced by Gorschek [34]. 
This model, which inspired our work, is inspired by the Pfleeger’s model   of technology transfer [35]. The Gorschek’s model proposes a seven-step   collaboration process, with a high-level view on each step. The seven   steps include: basing research agenda on industry needs, problem   formulation, candidate solution formulation, lab validation, static vali�dation, dynamic validation, and solution release. We considered this   model when thinking about how to facilitate industry-academia   collaboration in our context.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;To answer this question, we used   the qualitative research method of participant observation for data   collection. The data was collected continuously in a longitudinal study   spanning 8 years of the Certus Center existence. The data consists of field   notes taken during day-to-day discussions among the project partici�pants, as well workshops and focus group meetings dedicated to dis�cussing the Certus collaboration setup. The data also includes several   hundred emails exchanged between the project participants discussing   the collaboration. The data was analyzed to derive findings on the   collaboration which were validated by the project participants using the   member checking method. The findings were used to build the Certus   model which was iteratively refined throughout the collaboration as   more observation data and participants’ feedback became available. ;;;;;;"These notes include information such as motivations for collab�oration described by participants, choices of specific methods and   technologies for the solution development, the terminology used,   choices of evaluation metrics, the types of topics discussed, status up�dates, and behaviors and interaction patterns between the participants. 
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This paper presents the Certus collaboration model, which answers   the research question of what elements are needed for an industry�academia collaboration to support research knowledge co-creation in   SE. These elements are problem scoping, knowledge conception, K&T   development, K&T transfer, K&T exploitation, organisational adoption,   and market research. In our experience, a collaboration model sup�porting research knowledge co-creation has the potential to overcome   notable collaboration challenges such as the lack of relevance, interest,   and commitment from the collaboration parties. Compared to other   industry-academia collaboration models proposed in SE, the Certus   model presents a practical collaboration framework that details different   roles and responsibilities of project participants, ways of promoting   commitment and participative knowledge generation among project   participants, as well as some directions towards the commercialization   of research results. 
";;"There are several limitations and validity threats of the Certus model. 
Internal Validity. The collection of data underpinning the Certus   model relies on the participant observation method, which has several   limitations. First, the method is subjective as it represents a perspective   of an individual observer.";;"The model was developed iteratively, embodying only preliminary   elements of collaboration at beginning, and gradually evolving as the   collaboration progressed and as we gained more experience of co�creation. The very initial version of the model did not promote the   concept of co-creation early enough. For example, a Joint Team was not   formed already in the Problem Scoping phase, but more towards the   K&T Development phase. This resulted in a more loose ownership of the   problem definition by industry partners, and consequently less active   participation in concept development. After the benefit of forming a   Joint Team during a Problem Scoping phase became evident in one of   the scientific projects, the model was improved. 
Even if all model phases posed certain challenges for the model   development, there was one part which was the most challenging. That   was devising the metrics that can be used for measuring the K&T   exploitation impact. For most of our projects, it came down to measuring   the impact of a new tool that works as part of a bigger toolchain that   evolves and improves performance itself overtime. As a quantitative   metrics, we proposed to approximate RoI, which was sometimes   feasible. More feasible was to analyze an improved innovation capacity,   as a qualitative metric, through interviews and focus group discussions.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

These characteristics make the need of external acceptance for public-sector organizations   more signifcant. Accordingly, the quest for legitimacy by public organizations becomes   more urgent and signifcant (Kuipers et al. 2014). Thus, whether better understanding the   role of agency in bottom-up processes of change in public organizations represents a valua�ble efort for advancing change management literature, it is also important to know how the   change initiated within the organization is then accepted within and legitimized outside the   public-sector organization.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Most of the literature dealing with change in public organizations describes change either   in terms of a third-order nature—indicating external forces, such as public service reforms   and sector-specifc reforms (Battaglio and Condrey 2009; Askim et al. 2009) as the main   drivers—or, even without political intervention, as a planned, top-down process initiated   internally by the top management and then imposed to the rest of the organization (Higgs   and Rowland 2011; Karp and Helgø 2008; van der Voet 2014). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Thus, the application of a grounded theory approach for the analysis of the frst phase,   2014–2015, followed all these steps mentioned above and was specifcally intended at   understanding the opinions and ideas of diferent internal and external stakeholders with   respect to University’s activities at the time when we started our analysis. This starting   point was absolutely crucial for catching subsequent changes. The second-order codes   linked to this phase are “strong detachment from technology transfer activities”, “mistrust   with respect to University activities”, and “independence between University and politics”. 
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" We have identifed three separated but interrelated steps through   which a young university moves from being a disregarded actor in the region, to devel�oping its reputation by personally promoting activities related to innovation and technol�ogy transfer, and fnally making its role accepted and legitimated within the IE. While the   bottom-up process that we have described might be atypical (Thompson et al. 2018), a few   implications can be drawn.
First, the entry of the university as a key actor in a regional system potentially unfreezes   the existing equilibrium with respect to innovation activities when the university increases   social interactions with the other actors of the IE (Thompson et al. 2018; Spigel 2017). We   show that the emergence and role of the university in an IE depends on the spaces already   claimed by the other actors and by its negotiation potential. In other words, it depends   on the distribution of competences and may vary from region to region. In any case, the   university’s potential for changing established relationships, creating new ones and, thus,   playing an active role in the ecosystem through shifting collective understanding is also   functional for its legitimacy (Wooten and Hofman 2008).
Second, we add a process lens for understanding the transformation of an actor not   from the perspective of environmentally imposed changes processes but through proactive   interactions, role defnition and activities, that reshape the IE. Accordingly, an increase of   individuals within the university and individual relationships is critical in this frst phase   of the process. We found that an institutional void—which potentially seems a disadvan�tage—turns out to be an advantage in allowing the gathering of dedicated individuals to   the overall project by favouring bandwagon efects (Valente 1996). Thus, the institutional   void reduces barriers of adoption otherwise created by institutional obligations";; The implications of our research need   to be understood in light of its limitations. Case studies allow theoretical knowledge to be   extended but not tested. Our analysis was limited to a single case in a specifc region and   is thus context specifc. Future research could provide more comparative investigation.;;"Our   analysis was also actor specifc, investigating the specifc role of the University. In order to   understand processes of mutual adjustments, research on IE could focus more on dyads and   triads and study specifcally the mutual infuences between players.

Over two years, 14 case studies  were generated involving six university researchers and 61 teacher researchers.
As teacher researchers collected their topic-speciffc data, university researchers  worked in parallel on case studies at the 14 sites in an attempt to gain insights  into the types and value of collaboration in collaborative action research.
University researchers gathered 20–30 points of data for each case-study site  (including teacher researcher ffnal reports as well as journal entries, focus group  interviews, ffeld notes, video footage and questionnaires). Through comprehen�sive cross-case analysis, researchers were able to examine common traits as well  as relationships between the nature of the teams, the nature of the projects and  their relative success, to highlight conditions that led to robust collaborations.
Through pattern matching, hypothesised events were compared with observa�tions to test the claim that a triad of relationships between the team, the team  lead and the researchers functioned as a positive collaborative force that  propelled teacher team success in a generative ethos, even when faced with  substantial challenges.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In 2007, Capobianco described the following as the key characteristics of  collaborative action research:  (1) Research problems are mutually deffned by the teachers and the researcher;  (2) The teachers and researcher collaborate in investigating solutions to classroom�based problems;  (3) Teachers develop research competencies associated with data collection, analysis,  and interpretation, and the researcher (re)educates herself or himself in research  methodologies that are most appropriate to the context;  (4) The researcher and teachers share and shape their ongoing, personal, and critical  reffections as an integral part of the research process;  (5) Results from the collaborative action research contribute to the collective knowl�edge of teaching and learning and are shared with others with an eye to improving  education practices. (Capobianco 2007, 6)";;;;;;"In a middle-ground position, we argue that university researchers can be an  important ally and support to teacher teams who are conducting research and that,  as teachers build their research skills, university researchers are building their  understanding of teaching and learning as well as of how research methods can be  customised to speciffc and practical classroom contexts (Collins, Joseph, and  Bielaczyc 2004). In this way, university researchers are also expanding their under�standing of what constitutes important knowledge. For example, amidst scrutiny  about the credibility of action research ffndings, Anderson and Herr (1999)  developed ffve key criteria for high-quality action research:   outcome validity (the research solves the problem that stimulated the study,  or, better, the research caused teachers to reframe their questions in iterative  cycles of learning);   process validity (the study permits learning of practitioners and/or the system  and includes credibility considerations such as triangulation of perspectives  and methods);   democratic validity (the extent to which perspectives of all stakeholders are  included and the appropriateness of solutions to the context);   catalytic validity (the extent to which the research energises and transforms  practitioners); and   dialogic validity (whether the research is conducted within a community of  action researchers to ensure peer review).

A total of 163 surveys were delivered to all ofcially recog�nized Taiwanese universities and 145 responses were received, yielding a response rate   of 88.96%.

Shirahada and Hamazaki (2013) fur�ther argued that an innovation climate in R&D settings facilitates creative behaviors and   innovative performance. ;;;;;;;"The recognition of intellectual property has led to universities establishing intellectual   property ofces, technology transfer ofces, and technology licensing ofces to protect,   manage, and utilize internal intellectual property (Sine et al. 2003). Patents and technol�ogy licenses issued by universities generate substantial economic value for academic insti�tutions (Lach and Schankerman 2004). A growing trend among universities, therefore, is   to pursue technology transfer by forming start-up companies or issuing licenses to young   frms. Mowery (2011) argued that UIC facilitates business incubation in universities to   support academic invention for commercialization.
";;;"Universities’ innovation climate refers to the supportive activities taken for encouraging   UIC interaction and motivating technological innovation. Drawn upon the perspective of   organizational climate, the common values, shared beliefs, authority systems, and norms   is established and maintained within an organization, which essentially motivate organiza�tional members to share and create knowledge (Chen and Huang 2007; Tesluk et al. 1997). 
According to Bock et al. (2005) and Chen et al. (2012), innovation climate is a type of   organizational climate within which information fows openly and freely through social ";;;;;;;"A formal UIC management mechanism can be defned as controlled standardizations that   are stabilized in the operation of UICs as well as an activator for collaborative relationships   (Boardman 2009; Perkmann et al. 2011). In the framework of knowledge production func�tion, knowledge inputs (such as R&D expenditures) are expected to contribute to technol�ogy innovation output (such as the number of patents or new products) (Goldfarb 2008). 
However, innovation remains various problems and risks that are expected to be encoun�tered in the UIC process (Kaymaz and Eryiğit 2011). Formal structure is required in uni�versity–industry relationships to control and coordinate the process of R&D input, behav�ior, and innovative outcomes (Thune and Gulbrandsen 2011). Guerrero et al. (2014) argued   that internal management structure and decision-making mechanisms provide a support�ive environment where teaching and research activities can be transformed into social and   economic outputs. Meanwhile, government agencies delegate responsibilities to universi�ties to support academics in understanding the needs of industry, preparing UIC propos�als, earning public or industrial funding, and facilitating the commercial exploitation of   research outputs (Meyer et al. 2013; Weckowska 2015). Careful and efective management,   including administrative support and human capital, is crucial to improving the quality of   the UIC process and outcomes (Wong 2013)";;University research funding derived from private industries and the government refers to   the additional incentives provided to academics (Goldfarb 2008) and is critical in the R&D   measure of a nation’s technological capability (Hu and Mathews 2009).;;;;"The present study defnes the concept of UIC   rewards as monetary incentives to foster higher technological productivity in UIC projects.

First, all data regarding UIC circumstances   were collected from a single respondent by using perceptual measures. An adequate sam�pling technique and multiple respondents would be more appropriate for understanding the   real circumstance of UICs. In addition, this study does not consider the type of univer�sity (i.e., private, technology, or public) or frm size, which may be correlated with pos�sible resources and technological capabilities. ;;"To expand the scope of research conducted by UIC, new research agen�das should be established, including (1) the relationship between university characteristics   (e.g., public or private, size, professional felds) and UIC funding amounts; (2) the degree   of willingness for or participation in UIC and technology performance of various indus�tries; (3) the infuence of UIC on organizational changes in universities and industries; (4)   the development of entrepreneurial activities in universities and the expected market value   creation from such activities.

Universities have always been involved in KT   (or third stream) activities; they are not something new, ""somehow"" discovered in   recent years, as argued by scholars in the Triple Helix or Mode Two traditions   (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000; Gibbons et al. 1994), who propose the idea of a   new academic revolution that is characterized by universities becoming involved in   KT activitie";;"d.1 We aim instead to develop a critical review of those   aspects which, in our judgement, are relevant for an understanding of the current   governance of institutionalized KT activities in universities. As discussed in more   depth in the next section, there are various forms of KT activities, ranging from   collaborative research projects involving universities and companies (e.g. research   contracts), intellectual property rights (IPR) and spin-offs, labour and student   mobility, consultancy, etc., as well as ""soft"" forms of KT, such as attendance at   conferences and creation of electronic netwo";;;;;;;;;;;;;" KT was based on the assumption that the old model was not efficient for providing   the knowledge needed by the new knowledge-based economy (Etzkowitz 1983).

Although the answer   to these questions is far from clear, policy initiatives have been launched in several   countries to support formal institutionalized channels of exchange.

The analysis of relationships takes place on several levels: the first level, at which  the possible internal relationships between teachers and learners are highlighted,  and the second level, at which the analysis is extended to all those individuals in the  university concerned with the content and quality of teaching.

While presenting  characteristics of considerable flexibility, lending itself to subsequent improvements,  additions and processing to ensure greater adaptability to individual academic realities, the  model, structured on the information derived from the social reports/budgets of national  universities, may not respond to needs of universities with a great international vocation.
Our methodology to measure IC makes it possible to identify more comprehensively those  factors which are related to the value creation of first mission activities, i.e. human and  social capital. Choosing the set of indicators was not an easy task: university management  has to consider the lifetime of the indicators, strongly correlated with the pace of reforms in  higher education.
The information gained from the indicators should help to detect the causes of under�performance or inefficiencies and should also be compatible with the mission, the strategy  and organisational culture of the university and supported by the top management.
The indicators proposed in this paper will also need to be tested in European universities  to evaluate the effectiveness and the achievement of expectations, and guide universities in  improving their actions.

The experiences of Italian universities, while unique to Italy, are appli�cable to other nations, particularly countries that have regional specializations in low and   medium technologies that are experiencing increasing competition.

Figure 1 shows a schematic picture of those elements  at the country, organizational, and individual levels.
The ffrst step is to determine whether the knowledge  has a potential economic value and passes the  existence of organizational barriers (e.g., university  policies, attitudes among faculty and university  administrators, lack of incentives, etc.). The next step  is to perform an innovation disclosure when the  inventor/researcher decides whether or not to transfer  their inventions/academic research. Their research  must overcome economic fflters (e.g., the capability  to convert invention into commercial value) and  become intellectual property that can be commercial�ized via licenses to existing ffrms or via start-up of a  new ffrm (Carlsson et al. 2007). The last step is when  this knowledge contributes to the economic growth.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;In summary, the main contribution of this paper  was to explore the role of academics’ start-up inten�tions and knowledge fflters on the knowledge transfer  process within entrepreneurial university. However,  there are still missing points in the current studies of  the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship  (Qian and Acs 2013). There are many academic  implications. Concretely, Fig. 1 shows potential  research opportunities to explore the different steps  (generation, transference, commercialization, and  economic impact) across several levels of analysis  (country, organizational, and individual) and fflters  (individual, organizational, economic, commercial,  etc.) involved in the main foundations of the knowl�edge spillover theory of entrepreneurship.;;"Of course, this study has limitations.

The outcomes of entrepreneurial universities’ teaching activities  have a positive effect on economic development.
";;;;;;;An entrepreneurial university is characterised by organisational  adaptation to environmental changes (Clark, 1998), its managerial  and governance distinctiveness (Subotzky, 1999), new activities  oriented to the development of entrepreneurial culture at all lev�els (Kirby, 2002), its contribution to economic development with  the creation of new ventures (Chrisman et al., 1995), or the com�mercialisation of research (Jacob et al., 2003). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Our dependent variable is Ln GVA per capitat+2, where GVA is  the gross value added.

For this reason, and to avoid additional bias produced by the current  global ffnancial crisis (2008–2011), we adopted a lag of two years.
In addition, we used logarithms to reduce the possible variance that  arises due to the different scales/measures used. According to Sala�i-Martin (2002),the use of logarithms in economics allows for more  uniform measurement scales.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Based on our results, one of the interesting ffndings  of this study is that for the majority of the United Kingdom’s  universities, research activities have contributed the most to  economic growth. However, it is also interesting to note that  the entrepreneurial activities of universities contribute strongly  to economic development as well. The results show that the  economic impact of our control group (UK universities that are  not part of the Russell Group) is evident on research, teaching,  and entrepreneurial activities, with the highest impact associated  with research and knowledge transfer;;"the main limitations  are posed by the complexity and dynamic characteristics of uni�versity outcomes and their transformation into economic impacts.
Based on the variables and methods used, most previous studies  considered the role of the university under a managed economy,  where the traditional core activities of universities are linked to  teaching and research. In other words, in the managed economy,  the force is large-scale production, reffecting the predominant pro�duction factors of capital and unskilled labour as the sources of  competitive advantage, while in the entrepreneurial economy, the  dominant production factor is knowledge capital as the source of  competitive advantage, which is complemented by entrepreneur�ship capital, representing the capacity to engage in and generate  entrepreneurial activity (Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004b).

Coding and  analysis are to uncover the complexities and diversities in the institutionalization process  (Zilber 2008) and engagement patterns of the universities in response to the top-down  initiative of KE.
In the course of data analysis, researchers ffrstly studied the universities’ offfcial website,  which offers useful information concerning the mission, institutional history, university  structure, positioning and statistical ffgures which reffect the institutional characteristics  of the universities. The second step involved reading of the universities’ annual reports  for understanding the yearly highlights, new research and development, and especially  the KE initiatives and community-outreach missions. Thirdly, the KE reports submitted  exclusively to UGC on a yearly basis provide rich and detailed empirical ffndings about  industrial partnerships, patent generation, start-up companies, spin-off, and other entre�preneurial activities. Key performance indicators are especially useful for offering quantiffed  data about KE performance and output.

Early history may provide a  better guide for aspiring regions than abstracting elements from the contemporary Silicon Valley ecosystem with its  multiple interactive technology and business paradigms. Inducing permeability in academic boundaries is a first step to  creating an entrepreneurial university, the motive force of the most successful regional innovation clusters. After a high�tech cluster is achieved, the generative source of its firms is often forgotten, their origins obscured by highly visible  artefacts and symbols, like science parks or branding. The increasing dependence of Silicon Valley on external sources of  human capital and innovation is a potential Achilles heel, if compe;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"A five-phase spiral model, adapted from Etzkowitz and  Klofsten (2005),1 is utilized to specify roles and relation�ships in order to better understand the process of high-tech  cluster formation and growth. The model is non-linear in  that the phases do not necessarily occur in the following  sequence: origin – developing the capacity to create  high-tech firms through university–industry interactions;  expansion – generating a significant cluster including  high-growth firms, with Triple Helix interactions emerging  to solve problems and take regional development forward;  maturity – lateral organizations and networks are partially  displaced by hierarchical organizations with strong bound�aries; renewal – the ability to move from one technological  paradigm to another as a cluster declines, beginning the  start-up process over again; and efflorescence – the ability  to create and sustain multiple high-tech clusters in a region,  with all phases occurring simultaneously.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Innovative regions evolve from geographical, cultural and  industrial areas, traditionally based on a natural feature  such as New York harbour, the starting point for a global  business and financial hub, or the Tennessee Valley  watershed that became the setting for a hydraulic electrifi�cation and economic and social development scheme  (Adams and Butler, 1999; Eisinger, 1997; Lugar, 1994;  Markusen, 1996; ProInno-Europe, 2010; Scott, 1993; Tod�tling and Trippi, 2005).

Industrial society was based on govern�ment–industry relations; knowledge society is based on  university–industry–government interactions. The univer�sity of the future is an entrepreneurial institution with a  third mission, beyond teaching and research, to transfer  technology and be a proactive contributor to regional  innovation (Etzkowitz et al., 2000).

As  technological paradigms are exhausted, there is a return to  the inception phase and a focus on creating or accessing  new sources of research to ensure a flow of inventions into  the firm formation pipeline. As innovative regions attain  maturity, universities may step back from the proactive  entrepreneurial role they played in an earlier era. Legal  strictures of inurement limit the direct involvement of  universities in economic development to protect their  tax-free status (Donovan, 2011, Director of Real Estate  Development, Boston University, personal communica�tion (conversation with the author)).

It will discuss  how the HKSAR copes with the main challenges of university  governance by adopting policies and measures to creating a hybridized  ecosystem so as to embrace cross-sectoral collaborations. ;;;;;;;;;;;;This article aims to examine the changing university  governance in Hong Kong particularly when universities go beyond the  academia to work with industries and businesses to promote  innovation-centric entrepreneurialism. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" Triple Helix Model  Conventionally, researchers and academics have adopted the Triple Helix model to analyze collabor�ations between universities and industries or businesses (e.g. Leydesdorff and Meyer 2006; Lawler  2011). These collaborations promote innovation and entrepreneurship, emphasizing the tri-lateral  networks and hybrid organizations of government, universities, and industries (Powell and DiMaggio  1991; Etzkowitz et al. 2000).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" Hence, we need to move beyond  the Triple Helix Model to a Quadruple Helix Model when conceptualizing the changing univer�sity–industry–business–society relationships. Core to the Quadruple Helix Model is the signiffcant  contributions generated from the close interaction between the university sector, the local commu�nity, and society at large. The wide engagement of universities with society would inevitably require  us to abandon the narrow deffnition of KT with the value of commercialization of research output  (Miller, McAdam, and McAdam 2018; Mok and Jiang 2017; Rossi and Rosli 2015). ";;;"KT is not simply about technology transfer, it is also about the research output that would benefft  the society as a whole. A new competitive research funding scheme called New Research Impact  Fund (RIF) was launched by the government in 2017 to encourage impactful and translational research  projects that benefft the entire community and foster collaborative efforts among stakeholders  beyond academia, such as government departments, businesses, and industries (UGC 2017c). A  funding of HK$75 million (approximately USD9.66 million) was reserved for the RIF exercise of  2020/21 (UGC 2020a).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"‘third mission’ activities by commercializing academic research  and involving in socio-economic development, which are usually deffned as knowledge transfer  (KT) activities (Mok 2013a, 2013b, 2015; Mok and Jiang 2017, 2018). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"University diversity is not simply about scale, but also in terms of their visions and missions.
Knowing how to measure universities’ KT performance with their diverse visions and missions is  important. The EdUHK, for example, emphasizes its primary mission to ‘lead educational innovation,  and to promote and support the strategic development of teaching, teacher education and disci�plines complementary to education’ (The EdUHK 2020). As a liberal arts university, Lingnan University  aims to ‘excel as a leading Asian liberal arts university with international recognition, distinguished by  outstanding teaching, learning, scholarship and community engagement’ (Lingnan University 2020).
Universities with emphasis on non-STEM ffelds may not perform well in patents and licenses in their  KT performance. However, a low performance in one area does not imply that they could not perform  well in the KT performance.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Our discussion has clearly suggested that ‘collaborative governance’ across the multiple sectors  would have transformed the ecosystem in promotion of innovation-centric entrepreneurship in  Hong Kong. The government provides higher education institutions with the ffexibility to manage  their own business, but it does not mean that the government gives these institutions an entirely  free hand, especially when they use performance-based allocation to reach the UAA with the UGC.
This article attempts to conceptualize how the HKSAR has encouraged multiple sectors to ‘hybridize’  the ecosystem with the aim of fostering entrepreneurialism. Moreover, this article argues that the uni�versity governance in Hong Kong is changing whereby the ‘corporate model’ has combined with the  ‘collaborative model’ forming the ‘corporatized collaborative governance’ in order to create the  necessary conditions for transforming Hong Kong into a smart city with strong urban innovation,  creativity, and entrepreneurship.
";;While the analyses of ‘corporatized collaborative governance’ Model in this study focuses on how  public universities in Hong Kong respond to the call for collaborations with industries, businesses,  and the society, the responses of private higher education institutions among the multiple networks  and hybrid organizational arrangements remain unclear. ;;". In future, it is worthy to investigate whether  and how Hong Kong’s Chinese society with a British colonial history affects the university governance  model. It is equally interesting to further research on whether the university governance in Hong  Kong is particularly unique when comparing to its counterparts in the region.

(2) What is Bei�jing’s role in the national knowledge exchange network?
(3) How has the situation changed over time? Answers  to these questions would help us understand the role of  universities in China’s national and regional innovation  systems, the geographic constraint on university knowl�edge transfer in reforming China, the disadvantaged  position of those less favored regions in the knowl�edge transfer networks, and the implications on China’s  uneven regional development.
";;;;;;;;;Taking advantage of the Chinese patent data, this paper examines the geographic variations in university–industry collaborations  in China from 1985 to 2004 and shows a decentralizing/localizing trend in knowledge ffows from university to industry. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;It has been a difffcult question why regions differ  in their innovation capabilities and economic perfor�mance. Those successful ones that have established  themselves in the global market due to their possession  of certain social and institutional assets, such as “insti�tutional thickness” (Amin and Thrift, 1994), “untraded  interdependencies” (Storper, 1995a), “social capital”  (Morgan, 1997), and “relational assets” (Henry et al.,  1996), are often called “learning regions” (MacKinnon  et al., 2002). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Knowledge transfer from universities, which is often  embodied in codiffed forms (e.g., publications, patents,  contract R&D projects) and sometimes contains tacit  components (e.g., collaborative research, informal con�sultation), therefore becomes an important asset in  creating learning regions. Whether a region is well  embedded in knowledge transfer networks with local and  extra-local universities is a good indicator of this region’s  innovation potential. By systematically analysing the  geographic variations in knowledge transfer networks in  China, we can detect regional differences in their accessi�bility to both local and extra-local knowledge resources  and their potential of becoming learning regions, thus  helping us study uneven regional development and  providing policy makers with detailed guidance when  designing China’s national and regional innovation sys�tems.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"A number of studies have shown that university  research enhances local industry innovativeness at the  state level (Audrestch and Feldman, 1996; Branstetter,  2000; Jaffe, 1989) and the sub-state level (Anselin et  al., 1997), suggesting a geographic constraint on knowl�edge ffows from universities to industry. ";;;;;;;The  blockmodel analysis further reveals the roles of different provinces and municipalities in the National Innovation System and how  those had changed over time. Besides showing a vivid picture of the knowledge exchange patterns among Chinese provinces and  municipalities, the results suggest that the geographic constraint on knowledge ffows only becomes salient in China in recent years  due to the administrative decentralization and the economic reform. ;;;;;; Knowledge transfer networks  Figs. 5–8 show dynamic knowledge transfer networks  of provinces and municipalities in the four historical;;;;;;3.1.

Since the knowledge ffows in these networks are directed  from university to industry, outdegree of a province mea�sures how many times its higher education sector has  transferred technology to industry and indegree of a  province indicates how many times its industrial sec�tor has received knowledge from universities. These two  measures reffect the knowledge production and utiliza�tion patterns of the provinces, from which we can see  huge regional variations. For those hinterland provinces  lacking a strong university base, ensuring a high inde�gree is especially important in bringing in extra-local  knowledge.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; First, degree  centralities of the provinces and municipalities show  regional variations in their knowledge production and  utilization patterns. According to expansiveness and  attractiveness, the 30 provinces and municipalities can  be classiffed into 6 categories: declining knowledge  center, knowledge exporter, active generalist, self sus�tainer, knowledge importer, and isolate. ;;;;" Although fostering local and extra-local  knowledge transfer networks seems to be an efffcient  way to create learning regions, the implementation pro�cess is not unanimously successful and calls for further  study.

How long term university industry collaboration shapes the academic productivity of research groups;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"3.1. Methodological approach  In our research design, we apply a DID approach to assess the impact of academic  collaboration with industry on university research groups’ scientiffc production  and compare their production with that of other academic research groups that do  not collaborate with industry. This method is widely used in econometric studies  (Card & Krueger, 1994; Dehejia & Wahba, 2002; Heckman, Ichimura, & Todd,  1998) and is based on a quasi-experimental research design that compares the  mean value of a dependent variable over time between treatment and control  groups.
Since we examine the effect of a treatment (collaboration) over time and use panel  data, we employ a DID matching estimator with comparable research groups. Thus, we  can obtain a consistent estimate of the treatment effect of interest while addressing  potential selection bias due to observed covariates. Matching estimators in combination  with DID methodology can improve the quality of non-experimental evaluations  (Blundell & Dias, 2000). Matching techniques, such as PSM, add a more ffne-grained  comparison between two samples, ensuring similarity and, thus, improving compar�ability (Rubin, 1980). The DID matching estimator has the additional advantage of  eliminating unobserved time-invariant differences that standard matching estimators  fail to eliminate (Smith & Todd, 2005).
We used Villa’s (2016) Stata’s module to estimate the DID treatment effects using  a kernel density PSM. All estimations were restricted to the common support region by  using only those observations that lie in the intersection of the supports of the PS of the  treated and control observations";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"University-industry  collaboration; scientiffc  productivity; long-term  collaboration; knowledge  transfer; knowledge and  innovation";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; research groups;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This paper analyses the impact of long-term university-industry  collaboration on academic research productivity.

The academic beneffts of collaboration with industry can occur with greater  intensity over the long term because different and powerful interaction mechanisms  can act to reduce orientation barriers. Thus, long-term linkages can reduce problems  related to differences in universities’ and businesses’ orientation and transaction  barriers related to intellectual property confficts and contract management  (Dutrénit, De Fuentes, & Torres, 2010; Garcia et al., 2018; Motoyama, 2014;  Perkmann & Walsh, 2009; Tartari, Salter, & D’Este, 2012). The partners’ increasing  experience with collaboration, the breadth of the interactive projects, and the crea�tion of mutual trust between the partners are the primary factors that lower barriers  to collaboration over time (Cantner, Hinzmann, & Wolf, 2017; Rivera-Huerta et al.,  2011). Therefore, long-term collaboration can convert the short-term transaction  costs of engagement with industry into investments in new intellectual and academic  beneffts associated with collaboration, resulting in positive effects on academic  productivity and publishing. However, stronger linkages with ffrms in the long  term may lead to deeper orientation problems since engagement with industry can  INNOVATION 59

Engagement with industry not only enables knowledge transfer  and accelerates the exploitation of new inventions but also increases academic  productivity. In addition, policies should include requirements for academic  researchers to publish new papers related to their collaborative projects with  industry because researchers must be able to create mechanisms to benefft from  the complementary capabilities of industrial scientists with whom they collaborate.
This requirement could allow academic researchers and industrial scientists to  strengthen the generation and dissemination of new scientiffc and technological  knowledge. Moreover, because the long-term beneffts of collaboration are greater  than the short-term beneffts, policies should establish mechanisms that encourage  the maintenance of such relationships over time, especially through programmes  that consider the duration of collaboration between academic researchers and  industrial scientists.

International inter sectoral collaboration in university research centres innovation systems;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Two case studies  The analysis presented here consists of two case studies of centres engaged in collabo�rations that include partners from multiple nations and sectors. The cases involve cen�tres at the University of Southern California (USC) that were chosen because they meet  the criteria of having multiple partners, have been in existence for a signiffcant amount  of time, and continue to exist. Because work is ongoing in both centres, the focus is on  their origins, composition and activities rather than their outcomes.
The analysis below begins by describing USC’s relationship to the innovation sys�tems of the US generally and California in particular. Next, the cases themselves are  introduced involving the Airbus Institute for Engineering Research (AIER) and the  TCC Institute for Emissions Reduction in Marine Diesel Engines (TIER-MDE). The  discussion draws on published accounts of the centres’ mission, membership and  achievements, as well as statistical data about members’ innovation systems and litera�ture on the relevant national innovation systems. Principal investigators afffliated with  the centres were given the opportunity to review the case studies for accuracy.

It is used to address the following research questions: What role does the  NIS of the partner country play in shaping a centre’s international and inter-sectoral  collaborations? What is the relationship of each partner centre to its home country’s  innovation system? What features of the partner country’s innovation system create  challenges for international collaboration? What features of the partner country’s inno�vation system create opportunities for the centre?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"University research centres often involve a mix of inter-sectoral and international  collaboration. Although the contributions of federally-funded research centres to the  United States economy have been studied extensively, less is known about the inter�national aspects of university research centres. The collaborations involved are inffu�enced by opportunities and challenges arising from the national innovation systems  of each partner organisation. The centres may also contribute to the innovation sys�tems of the home countries of partners. In response, this article presents two case  studies of United States university research centres engaged in international and  inter-sectoral engineering research collaborations and the associated roles of the  innovation systems of California and the United States more generally, involving  France, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea. The case studies demonstrate the  feasibility, and also the limitations, of using published accounts to understand the  history, mission, and membership of such centres with international partners without  government funding – leading to the identiffcation of directions for future research  on centres with international membership. The membership of the centres suggests  that international collaborations may be a response to market and government failure  in the public production of knowledge.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The antecedents and consequences of establishing URCs with international partners  may differ from centres with only domestic members, especially those with government  funding as a primary source of support. Government-funded centres can be seen as a  public production response to market failures that result in underproduction of knowl�edge and skills (Winston, 2007). In the cases presented here, the centres rely on private  support from the non-profft and for-profft sectors.
Assuming that under-provision of research in the topical areas of these centres’  work is a market failure, the lack of government support for the research might be  interpreted through the lens of government failure. That is, government may not be  intervening here either because of a passive failure to recognise the problem or oppor�tunity, or by acknowledging (at least implicitly) that the beneffts of government  involvement in this research are unlikely to exceed their full costs (Weimer & Vining,  2015). These centres are perhaps best understood as non-proffts operating as supple�ments largely independent of government (Young, 2000), with governments possibly  ffnding it more difffcult to respond to challenges and opportunities that span their  national boundaries.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Concomitantly, the university itself is embedded in a national academic research  enterprise. The latter “not only includes the customary activities of academic research  and scholarship, but . . . also encompasses the related activities of research doctoral  education and the means by which the outcomes of academic research are transferred  to society” (Dill & van Vught, 2010, p. 5).
The academic research enterprise, in turn, is part of the innovation system, along  with policies, agencies, ffrms and institutions that shape innovation within a country  (Mowery & Sampat, 2005). A centre with inter-sectoral and international partnerships  is embedded in the academic research enterprise within its own innovation system,  while also being connected to the innovation systems of its international partners.
These innovation systems are explored primarily at the national level, but sub-national  and supra-national systems are also considered. The inffuences of these systems on a  centre and interconnected centres are the focus of this study.
The national innovation systems approach is useful as a way to describe complementary  relationships among different institutions for learning, knowledge transfer, and innovation  (Lundvall, 2007). Gray (2011) uses such an approach to study cross-sector research collabo�rations, including those in cooperative research centres. The strengths of the approach for  this type of inquiry include its inclusion of widely varied types of product and process  innovations, a holistic interdisciplinary perspective, and accommodation of the multiple  independent actors and non-linear processes that arise in systems developed through path�dependent historical evolutionary processes (Edquist, 2005). For public policy and adminis�tration, an innovation systems approach is especially valuable for its emphasis on the role of  institutions (Edquist, 2005) and the attention to social and political factors that give rise to  science and technology policy interventions (Gray, 2011).
The national innovation system approach has been criticised for inadequately  accounting for change in innovation systems (Hart, 2009), for neglecting the role of a  nimble business sector for successful innovation (Frankelius, 2009), for reliance on  concepts that are somewhat loosely deffned, and for failing to clearly deffne the bound�aries of innovation systems (Edquist, 2005). Such criticisms are acknowledged, while  appreciating that national innovation systems are valuable bases of analysis but do not  constitute a theory leading to speciffc predictions about innovation and change (Edquist,  2005).

They demonstrate the feasibility and limita�tions of using published accounts to understand the history, missions and membership  of centres with international partners and without government funding. Connections can  be found between members and home-country national innovation systems, but there is  not always a clear 1:1 relationship between an organisation and a country.
Future research on US centres engaged in international collaborations would benefft  from a sampling frame from which to select subjects either randomly or representa�tively. A useful ffrst step would be a census of centres with international partners.
While there is some research about centres located outside the US (eg. Bowers & Alon,  2010; Cassia, DeMassis, Meoli & Minola, 2014), this research is quite preliminary as it  lacks the unifying momentum of federal government funding that has driven research  on US-based centres.
Because centres span several years of research, case studies would also benefft from  a longitudinal approach that takes into account policy and other changes relevant to the  centres’ creation and activities. With a larger sample of centres, it may be possible to  identify institutions as antecedents and consequences of these international partnerships.
In particular, such a longitudinal study would allow for an evaluation of the outcomes  of centres.
Implications for practice could be found in four areas. First, science and technology  policymakers, university administrators, and other public offfcials in and beyond the US  should be aware of the potential for collaborations with US universities to complement  their local and national innovation systems. Second, universities in the US and elsewhere  that are considering international centre partnerships may want speciffcally to consider  partners’ home-country innovation systems. With an understanding of such systems, it  may be possible to maximise opportunities and minimise challenges at the beginning of  the partnership. Third, policymakers outside the US may evaluate whether their innova�tion systems are well aligned to benefft from partnerships with US universities. Fourth,  policymakers in the US may be under-estimating the prevalence of international collabo�rations because they are less visible and less studied compared to government-funded  centres. More explicit acknowledgement of these centres within the US national innova�tion system may increase the centres’ impact on innovation in the US.

";;;;;;;"+erefore, based on the basic framework of the  C-H model, we introduce the level of innovation  collaborative agglomeration Θ to the C-H model and in�vestigate the inffuence of IUR innovation collaborative ag�glomeration on regional innovation capacity from the  aspects of innovation factor input density and the collab�orative innovation.
After the introduction the level of innovation collabo�rative agglomeration Θ, equation (1) is rewritten as follows:  qi � Qi  Ai  � Ωi n  β  i k  1− β  i � �α  ΘcQi  Ai  � �(λ− 1)/λ  , (2)  where c is the coefffcient (c > 0). Take the logarithm of both  sides of equation (2) simultaneously, and then derive for ki  :  zqi  zki  � α(1 − β)  ki  qi  . (3)  Assume that the capital can move perfectly across re�gions so that, in equilibrium capital price, r is equal across  regions. +e marginal output of capital will be equal to  capital price when the factor market reaches equilibrium. So,  let zqi  /zki � r; then, we get the demand density of capital ki  :  ki � Ki  Ai  � α(1 − β)  r  Qi  Ai  . (4)  Substitute equation (4) into equation (2) to organize the  equation on innovation capacity:  Qi  Ni  � Ωλ/(1− α(1− β)λ)  i  α(1 − β)  r � �α(1− β)λ/(1− α(1− β)λ)  · n  (αλ− 1)/(1− α(1− β)λ)  i Θc(λ− 1)/(1− α(1− β)λ)  i .
(5)  By taking the logarithm of both sides simultaneously,  equation (5) can be rewritten as follows:  ln Qi  Ni  � λ  1 − α(1 − β)λ  lnΩi +  α(1 − β)  1 − α(1 − β)λ  ln α(1 − β)λ  r  +  αλ − 1  1 − α(1 − β)λ  lnni + c(λ − 1)  1 − α(1 − β)λ  lnΘi,  (6)  where ln(Qi/Ni) stands for regional innovation capacity,  lnΘi stands for innovation collaborative agglomeration level,  and lnni stands for human capital level. +e impact of in�novation collaborative agglomeration on regional innova�tion capacity depends on the sign of its coefffcient  c(λ − 1)/(1 − α(1 − β)λ), positive or negative. So, does the  level of human capital";;When 1 < λ < (1/α(1 − β)),  the coefffcient sign is positive, and innovation collaborative  agglomeration promotes regional innovation capacity. At  this stage, innovation collaborative agglomeration promotes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"the transfer and sharing of knowledge and information,  which makes the potential innovation cost decrease.
Knowledge innovation achievements can be quickly trans�formed into products through the production platform  provided by the enterprise; then, the innovation collabo�rative agglomeration level can be improved since the  feedback and encouragement from the revenue of products.
+e positive role of innovation collaborative agglomeration  in enhancing regional innovation capacity has been con�tinuously strengthened.
When (1/α(1 − β)) < λ, the coefffcient sign is negative,  and innovation collaborative agglomeration inhibits the  improvement of regional innovation capacity. Excessive  innovation collaborative agglomeration will eventually cause  crowding effects such as lowering the efffciency of IUR  collaboration and the relative inadequate supply of inno�vation infrastructure, and when the promotion effect of  innovation collaborative agglomeration on regional inno�vation capacity is weaker than the crowding effect, the  further improvement of the innovation collaborative ag�glomeration level is not conducive to the improvement of  regional innovation capacity.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Economic agglomeration can bring spillover effects through  sharing, matching, and learning. Ciccone and Hall [36] have  proposed the C-H production density model for exploring  agglomeration externalities due to the density of economic  activity. +e model assumes that the spatial distribution of  production factors is homogeneous, and output density is  determined by total output, total area, and inputs per unit  area. +ere are incremental returns to scale. +e basic form  of the C-H model under the above assumptions is as follows:  qi � Qi  Ai  � Ωi n  β  i k  1− β  i � �α Qi  Ai  � �(λ− 1)/λ  , (1)  where Qi and Ai are the levels of regional innovation output  and regional size, respectively, qi denotes the innovation  output per unit size of the ith region (i.e., the density of  innovation output), reffecting the agglomeration level of the  innovation economy, Ωi is the Hicks-neutral parameter, ni is  the employment density (i.e., the number of persons  employed per unit size: Ni/Ai  ), ki is capital density (i.e.,  capital input per unit size: Ki  /Ai), α(0 < α < 1) is the coef-  ffcient of return to labor and capital, which represents the  crowding effect of innovation collaborative agglomeration,  β(0 < β ≤ 1) is the share of labor input, λ is the parameter of  output density, and λ > 1, indicating the positive externalities  of innovation collaborative agglomeration.
";"+e collaborative agglomeration theory provides a  theoretical basis for this paper to investigate the problem of  innovation collaborative agglomeration of IUR from the  composite perspective of agglomeration and collaboration.
Innovation collaborative agglomeration of IUR has the dual  attributes of agglomeration and collaboration. On the one  hand, the innovation agglomeration in the IUR sector helps  to promote the formation of innovative industrial value  chains and bring cost advantages to members of the in�novation system, economies of scale, and city brand ad�vantages [21]. On the other hand, collaborative innovation  of IUR facilitates the full use of heterogeneous knowledge  and reduces the cost of innovation [19]. +erefore, inno�vation collaborative agglomeration can be understood as a  process in which all innovation entities (mainly the IUR  sectors) in the innovation agglomeration zone work together  to promote regional innovation capacity through comple�mentary advantages and collaborative cooperation. Com�pared with the concepts of agglomeration or collaboration,  innovation collaborative agglomeration has the connotation  of both agglomeration and collaboration, which helps to  grasp more comprehensively the interrelationship among  IUR departments within the agglomeration and thus pro�vides a reference for relevant government departments to  optimize the regional innovation structure and promote the  scientiffc formulation of policies related to the enhancement  of regional innovation capacity.

three departments of industry, university, and research  institution and mathematically derives the mechanism of  innovation collaborative agglomeration on regional inno�vation capacity. (2) Based on considering both the scale and  the quality of collaborative agglomeration, the entropy  method is used to measure the level of IUR regional in�novation collaborative agglomeration to achieve the ob�jective observation. (3) Under the framework of New  Economic Geography, a spatial weight matrix is introduced  to explore the spatial correlation between innovation col�laborative agglomeration and regional innovation capacity,  and a spatial econometric model is established to empirically  analyze the impact of innovation collaborative agglomera�tion on regional innovation capacity.

Speciffcally, there is a signiffcant negative spatial  correlation between the local innovation collaborative ag�glomeration and the innovation capacity of neighboring  regions in most of China in recent years, both at the  knowledge innovation stage and the outcome transforma�tion stage. +eoretically, enhancing the local innovation  collaborative agglomeration when innovation resources are  limited means attracting innovation resources from  neighboring regions into the local area, which objectively  leads to the rise and fall of local and neighboring regions’  innovation collaborative agglomeration scale. +is leads to a  negative correlation in the spatial distribution between the  increase in local innovation collaborative agglomeration and  the decrease in innovation capacity in neighboring areas.

This research fflls an unexplored gap in regards  to the impact of KM enablers (i.e. trust, knowledge self-efffcacy, reciprocal beneffts, top  management support, organizational rewards, organizational culture, KM system  infrastructure and KM system quality, openness in communication, and face-to-face (F2F)  interactive communication) on knowledge sharing (KS) that supports research collaboration  by faculty members. No prior research has focused on the impact of KM enablers that  inffuence research university members to share knowledge. A self-administered  questionnaire was employed on members of ffve research universities in Malaysia to collect  data; subsequently, 421 usable responses were analysed using partial least squares path  modelling. KS by members was inffuenced by trust, organizational rewards, organizational  culture, KM system quality, openness in communication, and F2F interactive  communication; in addition, research collaboration was strongly inffuenced by KS. The  KM–KS –collaboration model shows a KM inffuence of individual– organizational –  technological–communication constructs that encourages KS by members to support  research collaboration.
";;;;;;;;"H2. Knowledge self-efffcacy positively inffuences KS.
";;;"H4. Top management support positively inffuences KS.
";;;;;;"2.2.9. Openness in communication  Open communication encourages KS research at universities that nourishes and updates the knowl�edge of faculty members (Bennet and Bennet 2003). Open communication between members,  research teams, departments and faculties/schools is crucial to gain new teaching and research per�spectives; create a supportive culture at universities (Samaha 1996; Filipczak 1997); eliminate  bureaucracy and secrecy (Ma and Kim 2005); and build effective research teams or research  centres (Kotlarsky and Oshri 2005). Open communication at universities is the preferred means  to implement KM initiatives and strategies valuable to establish KS for a clear understanding of  work requirements, joint achievements, and collaborations among academic staff (Panteli and Sock�alingam 2005). It is hypothesized that openness in communication at research universities positively  affects faculty members to share knowledge. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:";"H3. Reciprocal beneffts positively inffuence KS.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"A member in the academic world may not share knowledge because they do not believe that  sharing their knowledge is valuable since knowledge self-efffcacy focuses on knowledge content  and a personal assessment of the value of knowledge. In addition, a member may not share knowl�edge because they think that the likelihood that a person will receive the information is low  (Wasko and Faraj 2005).
Almahamid, McAdams, and Kalaldeh (2010) believe that the self-efffcacy of faculty members  will improve by increasing individual knowledge and skills acquisition. Expectancy will be  higher if a member believes that new knowledge will increase the value of shared knowledge  (Cabrera and Cabrera 2002). A higher self-efffcacy results in an increased likelihood that a  member will engage and persist in research-related behaviour (Hazzan and Seger 2010). This  study anticipates that faculty members who believe that they can contribute towards the  sharing of valuable knowledge will further support research collaboration at research universities.
Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:";;;;;;;;;;;;;;"2.2.7. KM system infrastructure  KM involves the sharing of information; therefore, technology can be the means for searching,  storing updating, retrieving, and accessing information. KM system infrastructure actively facili�tate KS by members at research universities (Hansen, Nohria, and Tierney 1999). As posited by  McCampbell, Clare, and Gitters (1999), the role of a KM system infrastructure is in its ability to  support communication, collaboration, and the search for knowledge and information. Research  universities need to implement a KM system to connect members in order to enable interaction  and research collaboration (Arthur Andersen 1998) that will increase KS (Yaacob and Hassan  2005). A KM system infrastructure allows members to share their knowledge internally as  well as share it across a greater geographical area (Connelly and Kelloway 2003). KM system  infrastructure has reduced the economic cost of sharing information and knowledge over  various boundaries; in addition, it has also created social conventions on communication that  makes it easier to share information and knowledge among diverse groups within a university  or across universities (Jarvenpaa and Staples 2001). Therefore, KM system infrastructure  allows easy access among members to share knowledge, especially those who are very busy to  interact F2F on research-related matters (Connelly and Kelloway 2003). Jarvenpaa and Staples  (2001) observe that KM system infrastructure increased the technical and social connectivity at  universities through the facilitation of information and KS. Hence, research universities must  decide on the most appropriate KM system infrastructure that can be provided as a platform  that can consists of networks, computers, storage, web technologies, digital media, databases,  system software, software tools, applications, and databases. This study anticipates that a KM  system infrastructure at research universities positively inffuences members to share knowledge.
Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:";;;;;;;;;;;;;"2.2.10. F2F interactive communication  Nohria and Eccles (1992) illustrate that F2F interactive communication was more important than  electronic conversations (such as e-mail) that requires the subsequent use of more F2F communi�cation that would undermine the efffciency towards the sharing of knowledge at universities. Yuen  and Majid (2007) found that F2F interactive communication was the preferred form of sharing  since it provides instant feedback, helps in seeking clariffcation, and offers non-verbal clues.
Both of these researchers claimed that F2F interactive communication was popular since it  allows the accurate conveying of information and encourages fast feedback among involved  members. F2F interactive communication incorporated into the working culture of research uni�versities is essential to encourage and increase KS practices.
An effective mechanism for members to gain knowledge in a F2F interactive communication  was to request help from someone who may already possess essential knowledge or expertise.
This request may lead to a conversation that will facilitate the creation of new knowledge on  behalf of the member (i.e. knowledge seeker). This implies that conversations can be an effective  conduit for KS by members in F2F interaction (Pierce 2002). This context is built through com�munication and enabled by shared perspectives, language, and common understanding. F2F con�versation enables faculty members to learn together when producing collaborative research work  (Brown and Isaacs 1996). This study postulates that the level of F2F interactive communication  Asian Journal of Technology Innovation 257
by faculty members was positively associated with KS practices at research universities. There�fore, the following hypothesis is proposed:";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"2.1. The role of KM at research universities  Research universities provide knowledge; however, they also encourage knowledge collaboration  among existing researchers and educators (Goud, Venugopal, and Anitha 2006). Universities need  to be proactive to achieve competitive advantages via collaboration when it comes to KM in order  to obtain, create, and share knowledge, particularly in generating and disseminating new knowl�edge through research activities (Aziz 2006).
Researchers and practitioners have stated that KM is a crucial element due to its sustainable  and beneffcial source of competitiveness. KM is important to research universities due to the  massive availability and complexity of knowledge-based resources. The loss of these valuable  resources may occur if knowledge assets are not systematically acquired, managed, and controlled  (Ismail and Chua 2006). Universities must recognize the true value of intellectual capital and  manage intangible assets that can be fully utilized and adapted in a knowledge-based learning  society to support the education sector of Malaysia (Metaxiotis and Psarras 2003).
Academic institutions ffnd it difffcult to grasp the beneffts of KM to provide efffcient oper�ational practices and enhanced competitiveness (Hijazi and Kelly 2003). Universities lack an  in-depth understanding of KM and how it attaches to institutional performance outcomes. KM  is usually discussed at universities in terms of technological advances and solutions that often  ignore the individual and organizational aspects of KM implementation and programmes.
An extensive approach by a university towards KM can lead to a subsequent advancement and  growth advantage entailed with KS because research collaboration is the base for new knowledge  that makes KS a central focus (Chen et al. 2009).
In Malaysia, research university status was designated under the Malaysian Research Assess�ment Instrument by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) to the Universiti Malaya (UM),  Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Universiti  Putra Malaysia (UPM), and Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM). These universities are recognized  252 C.N.-L. Tan and S.M. Noor
as research universities in Malaysia for their crucial position in research expansion and commer�cialization activities due to the relationship of economic growth and R&D activities. The foun�dation of a university mission is the commitment to intellectual discovery and development;  subsequently, research universities are expected to lead in the advancement of innovation at  the national level, to develop world-class academic output, and create a conducive environment  for research and innovation. The research output reputation of a research university helps it attract  and retain high-performance academic staff (nationally and internationally) who assist in contin�ued growth. As stated by Aceto (2005), a university that does not provide facilities for research is  not a university. In this research, KM is viewed as a key facility that a research university requires  in order to provide a conducive environment for research and innovation.
";;;;;"2.2.8. KM system quality  KM system quality refers to the quality of knowledge provided by the KM system (Lin 2011) that con�sists of knowledge accuracy, relevance, exchange, reliability, and accessibility that are highly valued  256 C.N.-L. Tan and S.M. Noor
by individuals at an institution (DeLone and McLean 2003; Nelson, Todd, and Wixom 2005). Kulk�arni, Ravindran, and Freeze (2006) proposed that higher learning institutions require a high-quality  KM system that is accessible and capable of easily leveraging KM practices by faculty members.
To encourage KS beyond a university’s boundary, a KM system should provide appropriate  functions with excellent qualities (Hall 2001; Alavi and Tiwana 2002). KM system quality is an  enhanced construct that originates from system quality in the information system ffeld (Wu and  Wang 2006) that may include availability, ease of use, stability, and response speed. Research uni�versities with greater KM system readiness and a higher KM system quality are more likely to  create sustainable growth sources and pursue best KM practices. This study anticipates that a  higher KM system quality results in more knowledge that will be shared by members. Therefore,  the following hypothesis is proposed:";;;;;;;"2.2.4. Top management support  Top management support is deffned as the involvement and participation of top-level management  in institutional activities (Jarvenpaa and Ives 1991). Top management support was the degree to  which top management understands the importance of KM and the extent to which top management  was involved in KS practices at the university. KM involves a process of wide-range organizational  change initiatives that surpass strategic management efforts (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000). Support  from top management is critical in the growth of KM practices since it encourages the voluntary  participation of members to share vital knowledge (Kang, Kim, and Chang 2008). Faculty  members need to understand that top management supports KM efforts at their university or  254 C.N.-L. Tan and S.M. Noor
they may be unconvinced that it was a valid innovation and feel uncomfortable in offering  knowledge.
The importance of visible top management support for the KS climate at research universities  was further emphasized by MacNeil (2004) due to its prominence in the creation and maintenance  of a positive KS culture (Lin 2007a,b; Lin and Lee 2006; Lin et al. 2009). Positive support added  with personal orientation from the upper management is crucial to create a culture that encourages  the unceasing sharing of knowledge (Lin and Lee 2004; Xu and Quaddus 2012). It was believed  that KS could not succeed at any academic institutions without the commitment and involvement  of top management (Leibowitz 1999). Top management support (e.g. faculty/school deans) who  exhibit independent KS behaviour and motivate other inffuential members to publicly share  knowledge acts as a driver for overall research collaboration. It was predicted that high levels  of top management support at research universities may encourage the willingness of faculty  members to share knowledge";"2.2.11. KS and research collaboration  KS can only work if a particular university promotes it (Stoddart 2001); subsequently, there is a  need to change individual – organizational –technological –communication constructs of the uni�versity to effectively encourage KS. Simultaneously, Steyn (2004) stressed that the upper man�agement should emphasize individual (i.e. people) aspects as well as organizational,  technological, and communication aspects in order to harness knowledge power at a research uni�versity. Yeh (2005) stated that university management should look into policies and practices that  help faculty members share and manage knowledge wisely.
Hooff and Weenen (2004) supported the notion that KS is composed of mutual communication  between individuals that combines the knowledge of sender and receiver whenever members share  the knowledge possessed by a member that was converted into a form understood and required by  others (Ipe 2003). The KS deffnition was narrowed down in this study as a process that captures the  expertise of members, no matter where they exist; distributing it for the biggest possible mutual  benefft of members and research universities (Krogh, Ichijo, and Nonaka 2000).
Research collaboration is a method to share collaborative knowledge by faculty members  involved in planned or unplanned collaborative research. This collaboration involves informal story�telling, support or advice, sharing methods, materials, and ideas or joint research work where aca�demic staff can share responsibilities (Cornelissena et al. 2011). It is essential to understand the  research collaboration needs of a university in order to further deffne university collaboration pol�icies that support research collaboration among members. The need for collaborative research  work includes: (1) extraction of knowledge generated by university-level research work, (2)  ensure that research work continues with a speciffc direction, (3) obtain knowledge from wherever  it is, (4) avoid research work duplication and repetition since research work is a continual process, (5)  ffnd a perfect direction so that research work can be done efffciently, and (6) obtain original knowl�edge directly from universities that reduces the time to conduct industrial-level research.
Faculty members at research universities need to realize that efffcient interactive research col�laboration increases individual effectiveness that contributes to the generation of a research capa�bility that is vital to university performance (Kogut and Zander 1996). Kim and Ju (2008)  observed that universities tend to produce new knowledge that results from the processing of  existing knowledge; however, there was a need for a systematic structure to help members  share knowledge and collaborate effectively since efffcient collaboration among members  increased effectiveness. One of the possible formal instruments to realize the exchange and  reuse of knowledge by members was a campus-wide knowledge-base that acquires, organizes,  and distributes newly created knowledge for collaboration. This study claims that KS at research  universities positively encourages collaborations among faculty members when conducting  research. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:";;;;;"2.2. KM enablers  After a review of the literature on KM, this study investigated 10 critical KM enablers: trust,  knowledge self-efffcacy, reciprocal beneffts, top management support, organizational rewards,  organizational culture, KM system infrastructure, KM system quality, openness in communi�cation, and F2F interactive communication. These enablers were postulated to inffuence KS by  faculty members in research collaboration at ffve research universities of Malaysia.
";;;;;;;;"2.2.1. Trust  Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, and Camerer (1998) showed that trust was a ‘psychological state compris�ing the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions of be�haviour of another’ (p. 395). Trust is the belief of an individual (i.e. trustor) that the other person  (i.e. trustee) is benevolent, reliable, competent, open, and honest when knowledge is shared due to  collaboration (Cornelissena, Swetb, Beijaarda, and Bergen 2011).
We argue that trust is an important element in the relationships of faculty members that  involves knowledge providers and knowledge recipients (Yusof and Suhaimi 2006). Trust  works well to encourage KS by facilitating a more proactive and open relationship among  faculty members that allows knowledge to be exchanged smoothly.
Trust increases sincerity in knowledge exchange and facilitates joint or mutual problems that  may arise (McEvily, Peronne, and Zaheer 2003) as a high level of trust eases KS. It is considered  to be a ffrst step for effective KS when it comes to the creation and sustentation of KS by members  at research universities. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:  H1. Trust positively inffuences KS.
2.2.2. Knowledge self-efffcacy  Termed as individual beliefs about the value of shared knowledge to others, knowledge self-efff-  cacy refers to individual success at and willingness to undertake a task. It is partially derived from  individual beliefs about competence and ability to share. Knowledge self-efffcacy is the judge�ment of a faculty member in regards to the capability to organize and provide knowledge that  is valuable to the faculty/school to achieve speciffc levels of performance (Lu, Leung, and  Koch 2006). Consequently, members need to believe that capabilities and knowledge can  enhance the performance of their university (Ba, Stallaert, and Whinston 2001), assist in  solving research problems (Constant, Sproull, and Kiesler 1996), and achieve a competitive  advantage (Wasko and Faraj 2005).
";;;;;;;"2.2.3. Reciprocal beneffts  Several researchers (Lin 2007a,b; Lin, Lee, and Wang 2009) believe that reciprocal benefft was  important because it provides an effective drive to facilitate KS by faculty members and achieve  long-term cooperation at universities (Bock, Zmud, and Kim 2005; Kankanhalli, Tan, and Wei  2005). Reciprocity can inspire KS when faculty members at research universities (who share their  knowledge with others) expect beneffts from sharing behaviour by receiving useful knowledge in  return (Davenport and Prusak 2000). For that reason, reciprocal knowledge is deffned as future  knowledge requests met by others (Kankanhalli et al. 2005). The expectation to receive knowledge  from a member may be viewed as an incentive to share knowledge (Lin 2007a,b). Lin (2007a,b) con-  ffrms that reciprocity behaviour at a faculty/school can provide a sense of mutual indebtedness, lead  knowledge contributors to improve their interpersonal relationships and increase expectation for  future help from others in ensuring a continually supportive KS. Cho, Gay, Davidson, and Ingraffea  (2007) emphasized that the perception that a member will receive knowledge was an important indi�cator of KM outcomes and that the perception of reciprocity was related to the use of KS mechan�isms. Hence, members were more likely to view KS favourably and have a higher tendency to share  knowledge at universities if they believe they can obtain reciprocal beneffts from others by sharing  knowledge. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:";;;;;;;;;;;;;"2.2.5. Organizational rewards  Organizational rewards range from monetary incentives (such as increased incentive and bonuses)  to non-monetary rewards (such as promotion incentive and job security) (Hargadon 1998;  Davenport and Prusak 2000) and help to shape the behaviour of faculty members (Cabrera and  Bonache 1999). As ascertained by Lin (2007a,b), organizational rewards were useful to  encourage staff to share knowledge as they believe that they will receive extrinsic incentives  (i.e. salary). As such, it is believed that faculty members will value intangible rewards (such as  additional sabbatical leave dedicated to research, ffnancial support for research-related travel,  and support for seminars) and ffnancial incentives (Gustad 1960).
Past research suggests that reward systems can encourage faculty members to share knowl�edge when rewards are provided in exchange (Al-Alawi, Al-Marzooqi, and Mohammed 2007).
In this study, organizational rewards at research universities are believed to enhance efforts by  members and their contributions to university performance (Yu, Kim, and Kim 2004). For  example, those that participate in KS will receive organizational rewards for their contributions  and can inffuence institutional commitment by members (Beer and Nohria 2000). In contrast, a  lack of rewards will be a barrier in KS (Yao, Kam, and Chan 2007). Apparently, members can  develop a greater willingness to share knowledge by offering knowledge to others only if they  believe that they can receive expected incentives from the top management of universities.
Rewards stimulate KS that allow members to believe that their performance should be commen�surate (McDermott and O’Dell 2001). Therefore, this study expects an important relationship  between organizational rewards and the sharing of knowledge among academic staff at research  universities. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"3.2. Measurement  Self-administered questionnaires were developed using a 7-point Likert scale (i.e. ranging from  1 ¼ strongly disagree to 7 ¼ strongly agree). The instruments used included a total of 55  items (see Appendix 2) taken from prior valid scales (i.e. 13 items for individual KM enablers,  15 for organizational KM enablers, 10 for technological KM enablers, 8 for communication  KM enablers, 5 for KS, and 4 for research collaboration). A pre-test was conducted to conffrm  that the questions were understood and that no ambiguity existed.

Kochenkova 2015 - Public policy measures in support of knowledge transfer activities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"To address this gap, this study provides a classiffcation of existing studies of the role of  government in facilitating the commercialization of academic research and university–  industry collaborations. Compared with previous literature reviews of technology transfer  policies (e.g., Bozeman 2000; Geuna and Muscio 2009), this article presents several novel  elements. First, we adopt a precise focus on policy measures to foster technology transfer  activities at the national or regional level, whereas previous studies consider, in more  general terms, relevant contextual factors or university-level policies. Second, this study  introduces several new analytical dimensions for classifying existing literature, which  should facilitate the identiffcation of unaddressed issues and promising avenues for re�search. Speciffcally, we classify existing literature according to the policy measures im�plemented, for which we identify three macro-level policy interventions analyzed  previously: legislative/institutional reforms, direct ffnancial support measures, and com�petence-building measures. In addition, we delineate the focus of prior studies, whether on  the design of public policy measures in support of technology transfer or on the ultimate  impact of those measures. Whereas the former category adopts a descriptive approach to  the aims and features of various policies implemented in different countries, the latter set  of studies seeks to assess the effectiveness of programs using different approaches and";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Public policy measures ​ Government support of technology transfer ​  Commercialization of university research ​ Knowledge transfer from academia to industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; knowledge transfer  activities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The systematic review of academic studies on public policy  measures in support of technology transfer presented by this article suggests a literature  classiffcation based on two dimensions: the type of policy measure analyzed, and the focus  of the study (i.e., policy design vs. impact assessment). On the basis of this comprehensive  review, we summarize the lessons learned thus far, identify research gaps that continue to  limit insights into public policy measures for technology transfer, and highlight directions  for further research.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;For the purposes of this review, we identify two conceptual dimensions for classifying  extant articles. First, we classiffed existing literature according to the type of public policy  measure reported. Our analysis revealed analyses of three macro-level public interventions  in technology transfer. Legislative/institutional reforms deffne the rules and boundaries for  undertaking technology transfer activities between universities and industry actors in a  country. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Arguably the most signiffcant hurdle among market inefffciencies is the so-called  funding gap, that is, the lack of private funding sources available to support technology  transfer activities and academic spin-offs, even among more ‘‘advanced’’ or risk-oriented  investors, such as venture capital ffrms or business angels (Munari and Toschi 2011;  Salmenkaita and Salo 2002). ";;"A set of mechanisms recently has emerged in several countries, under the label ‘‘proof-of�concept funds’’ (PCF) or similar names (e.g., translational funds, pre-seed funds, proof-of�principle fund, fonds de maturation; Bradley et al. 2013; Gulbranson and Audretsch 2008;  Maia and Cara 2013). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Finally, academic literature notes the existence of a knowledge gap, because academic  researchers and entrepreneurs might lack the managerial skills and competences needed to  advance their technologies or start-ups to a point at which it is possible to negotiate  successfully with industrial partners or external investors (Rasmussen and Rice 2012). T;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"university intellectual property right (IPR) reforms in various countries, fol�lowing the path-breaking Bay–Dole Act in the United States (e.g., Baldini et al. 2006;  Goldfarb and Henrekson 2003; Mowery and Sampat 2005). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;These barriers and gaps between new knowledge generators (universities) and intended  adopters (industry, public administration, society at large) have prompted actions by na�tional and regional authorities and policy makers, which aim to increase the effectiveness  of commercialization and knowledge transfers from academia to enhance their economic  and social impacts (Feldman et al. 2002). ;The increased numbers of technology transfer across countries in recent decades have, in  large part, been supported by public policy measures dedicated to fostering technology  transfer activities by universities or public research organizations (Feldman et al. 2002). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Just as there are differences in the goals and priorities of various actors, expertise,  cultural, and language differences arise between academics and potential users of the  technology (Rogers 2002), which can create a communication gap in different phases of  the technology transfer. This gap provides another rationale for government intervention,  because poor comprehension of academic language or principles by industry players, as  well as a general lack of awareness or understanding of business culture and the re�quirements of the commercialization process among the academic actors (Rasmussen and  Rice 2012; Stankiewicz 1998), hinder knowledge and technology ffows. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;"performance indicators. Both these dimensions of analysis facilitate our interpretations of  extant ffndings; they also highlight research gaps and promising research avenues. Third,  our proposed classiffcation helps clarify salient issues and provides insightful implications  for policy makers who seek to design evidence-based policies.
";;;;;; Legislative/institutional measures  Studies that address legislative reforms introduced in different countries to promote  technology transfer generally provide an overview of legislative reforms pertaining to the  ownership of the patent rights or the commercialization of academic inventions and;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;However, we uncovered very few studies that  investigate these measures. Some examples of relevant studied policy measures include the  Danish Action Plan for Entrepreneurship, the SPINNO Training Program in Finland, and  the Science Enterprise Challenge in the United Kingdom, which fund universities (Mustar  2002). The previously discussed IPM measures in Canada (Rasmussen 2008) launched and  sponsored technology transfer internship programs that were available only to consortia of  universities, colleges, or hospitals, possibly in collaboration with non-academic organi�zations. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"With this review, we have sought to classify and  summarize existing literature on such policy measures, so as to take stock of the lessons  learned and highlight the overlooked questions that remain. Our review reveals a series of  important gaps and issues to consider with regard to the design and impact of government  support in this domain.
A strong imbalance marks the research attention devoted to various types of policy  measures. Whereas some actions have been investigated by many contributions, such as  reforms of university IPR regimes, others have received only scant attention. The design,  characteristics, and effectiveness of other legislative measures, beyond those related to the  ownership of university IPRs, need to be investigated in much more depth. In particular,  research should consider the degree of autonomy of universities or the legal status of  researchers and TTO managers. ";;;"Another promising research direction would be to assess the impact of speciffc funding�related initiatives (e.g., seed funds, subsidy schemes, PCF). For example, does the impact  of policy measures vary according to the level of implementation (national/regional/local),  the degree of involvement of universities or PROs (i.e., direct management or not), the  level of the target beneffciaries (e.g., TTOs, academic spin-offs, individual researchers), or  the context? Considering the lack of research into competence-building measures, we also  call for more attention devoted to analyses of the optimal structure of this type of public  support actions, along with detailed assessments of their impact.

";;;;;;;;;Entrepreneurial academics and academic   entrepreneurs: a systematic literature review ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; we present two summary definitions of the different types of academic   which will help improve clarity of future research within the field. We define an   entrepreneurial academic as being an “academic faculty member who adopts an   entrepreneurial outlook through seeking opportunities to support their research and   teaching objectives by engaging with commercial partners in a range of collaborative and   less formal modes of engagement”. In contrast, we identify an academic entrepreneur as   being an ‘academic faculty member who undertakes technology commercialisation, using   formal modes of engagement that capitalise on specific market opportunities’.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Stage one involved a key word search. To help identify the boundaries of the subject,   experts were consulted who helped to identify keywords which would fully encapsulate   the entrepreneurial academic and academic entrepreneur phenomena. Initially, eight   keywords were identified, namely; ‘academic entrepreneur’, ‘entrepreneurial academic’,   ‘academic capitalism’, ‘academic work’, ‘academic entrepreneurship’, ‘academic   enterprise’, ‘academic engagement’, ‘academic impact’ and ‘research impact’. However,   through discussion with two academic experts, two knowledge transfer senior managers   and two technology transfer strategic managers, the key words of academic   entrepreneurship and academic enterprise were deemed redundant and would be captured   under the term ‘impact and universities’. This left a total of six keywords. 
Once keywords had been agreed, stage 2 was the journal search. Through   consultation with experts in stage 1, it was identified that peer reviewed articles over the   past 25 years would be reviewed (1990–2015) which signals a period in time where   academic roles have changed significantly. To ensure academic quality, only journals   which were deemed to be recognised leading journals in the fields of higher education,   entrepreneurship and innovation were selected. This resulted in the identification of 17   journals shown in Appendix 1. Key words were then converted into search strings to   conduct an article title search. At this stage the sample size was 273 articles. 
The third stage involved scanning and selecting articles for inclusion. This was done   through reading the abstracts of identified journals to determine relevance. This reduced   the sample size to 114 articles. This then led into stage four which involved data   extraction. Each of the articles were downloaded and reviewed according to a   standardised set proforma (Tranfield et al. 2003). This proforma formed a raw data   repository to be utilised in stage 5. Appendix 2 provides the proforma template and three   entry samples. In addition, a handful of ‘specific’ papers were then included if there were   two separate references made to their content within the previously selected articles. This   ensured the inclusion of seminal content that might be potentially excluded due to being   outside the time window chosen, located in journals from other subjects or arising from   important policy documents. This resulted in a total sample size of 129 papers. 
The final stage involved analysing the data from selected articles to identify core   themes and future research agendas. ";;;;;;"Initially, eight   keywords were identified, namely; ‘academic entrepreneur’, ‘entrepreneurial academic’,   ‘academic capitalism’, ‘academic work’, ‘academic entrepreneurship’, ‘academic   enterprise’, ‘academic engagement’, ‘academic impact’ and ‘research impact’.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"From the literature it was delineated that academic entrepreneurs favour spin-outs,   patents and licenses, joint ventures and opportunities to share development facilities with   industry as modes of engagement that enable them to commercialise their research. In   contrast, entrepreneurial academics are more aligned to networking, joint industry   conferences, joint journal publications, joint supervision (of research students) graduate   and student placement, secondments, executive education, collaborative research and   contracted research and consultancy. It is hoped that by presenting these definitions,   future research can more clearly distinguish between different types of academics to

            avoid ambiguity over what knowledge transfer activities certain academics perform. It is   acknowledged that an academic can be both an academic entrepreneur or an   entrepreneurial academic or indeed, neither, if they engage in pure basic, non-applied   research activities (Alexander et al., 2015). Having recognition of the different roles   academics play with regards their engagement in knowledge transfer with industry   provides the first step in recognising the importance of less formal models of engagement   to achieve a universities mission of becoming entrepreneurial (Link et al., 2007; D’este   and Perkmann, 2011; Perkmann et al., 2013). Furthermore, this helps provide clear   distinctions between the different engagement activities academics have with industry.";;This research has a few limitations. First, the papers reviewed span 25 years however,   it is acknowledged that evidence of entrepreneurial activities within universities precedes   1990. Furthermore, the authors targeted the top innovation, entrepreneurship and higher   education journals however, it is acknowledged that this may not have fully captured the   wide range of papers published within this topic however, the rigorous SLR followed   ensured that the key seminal articles within this research area was captured. Finally, we   acknowledge that in some aspects of the review, we have been over reliant on specific   articles.;;Future studies should attempt to capture the value and impact less formal university   knowledge transfer activities have for industry and wider society ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Postcode districts vary in geographic size according to   whether an area is rural or urban, so in our empirical analysis we pay careful attention to   controlling for a range of other factors that may determine the concentration of R&D   establishments and universities in a particular postcode district. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; We find that pharmaceutical firms locate R&D near to frontier chemistry   research departments, consistent with accessing localised knowledge spillovers, but also   linked to the presence of science parks. In industries such as chemicals and vehicles there is   less evidence of immediate co-location, but those innovative firms that do locate near to   relevant research departments are more likely to engage with universities. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;According to Oztel [48], we  need a new “exemplar” of a university—an institution he calls  a “fourth-generation university.” Fourth-generation universities  are deffned as higher education institutes that join with core  stakeholders to cocreate and promote sustainable growth for  the socio-economic environments in which they operate. Going  beyond education, research, and third-mission impacts, these  universities negotiate, collaborate, and mutually cocreate value  [49] to secure public value for a sustainable future. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;he concept of  academic citizenship is deffned as the creation of different forms  of public value through community engagement, like in the  case of citizens and interaction with multiple stakeholders, like  start-ups, venture capitals, and large companies ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Thus, public administrators and politicians might  consider establishing incentives and reward mechanisms based  on a university’s performance in creating social and economic  value. The dialogs and multidialogs within stakeholder networks  where universities are one of the poles is territory that has not yet  been explored in-depth [78].;;;;By deffnition, achieving the SDGs requires an interdisci�plinary approach [74], [75]. However, it also requires rethinking  the traditional dynamics of dialog between universities and  their ecosystems. Moreover, the strategic drivers behind a more  sustainable future mean most universities will need to reshape  their relationships with stakeholders to embrace citizen science;;;"The “third mission” is another sphere of  inquiry. Here, the third mission is viewed as a transversal process  for transferring knowledge from teaching and research to the  community through formal and informal ffows of information.
The studies most relevant to sustainability focus on the concept  of entrepreneurial universities [43]–[47].

Lombardi 2018 - Entrepreneurial universities and strategy;Entrepreneurial universities and strategy: the case of the University of Bari;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"– The research question is answered through an exploratory case study  of the University of Bari, Italy. Data were collected from strategic plans, annual reports, national evaluation  reports and semi-structured interviews with the university’s board members and analysed using Secundo  et al.’s (2016) collective intelligence framework.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Diversification, Internationalization, Entrepreneurial university, Intellectual capital, Strategy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The understanding of entrepreneurial universities (Etzkowitz, 1983; Clark, 1998;  Philpott et al., 2011; Etzkowitz, 2016) is even more relevant today as new university  models are emerging, and, as outlined in the call for papers of this special issue, they  present a contemporary research opportunity. In response, we investigate the strategy  development of new entrepreneurial universities and build on the university’s intellectual  capital (IC). More precisely, we analyse the exploratory case study of the University of  Bari to examine why the university chooses a particular business strategy to become an  entrepreneurial university, and how university IC supported the university’s aim to  become a knowledge hub to support the social and economic development in its operating  ecosystem (Secundo et al., 2018).
";"ependent creators of knowledge that might be threatened by entrepreneurial activities.
The development of a knowledge economy leads to scholars expressing different  opinions. According to Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (2000, p. 313), entrepreneurial  universities encompass a “third mission” of economic development, adding to research  and teaching activities an entrepreneurial role. Here, entrepreneurial universities interact  with industry and government, shaping a “triple helix” that also contributes to a developing  society. This triple helix approach has been further analysed based on a “Mode 3”  Knowledge Production System (Carayannis et al., 2016) that pushes universities to perform  “basic research in the context of application”. T";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;To answer this research question, we used Yin’s (2014) case study methodology. Compared  to quantitative approaches, the qualitative approach of a case study allows researchers to  discover and understand the relationships between variables in complex processes (Shah  and Corley, 2006). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" The purpose of this paper is to investigate why entrepreneurial universities choose a particular  business strategy focussing on diversification and multi-nationalisation, and the role of intellectual capital (IC)  in supporting such strategies.
";;;;;Thus, we examine  knowledge asset management through the key dimensions of what, who, how and why to  answer the research question, resulting in both theoretical and practical contributions. This  framework was selected as it allows for the identification and analysis of how universities  strategically manage and measure IC contributing to the social and economic development  (Secundo et al., 2018). ;;;;;;"Interestingly, as  members of the triple helix, glocal and multinational universities deal with different  contexts, countries, cities and communities that have different needs, which may influence a  university’s strategy to diversify or specialise. Thus, the evolution of IC research, and its  role in supporting university strategies, drives our research question as follows:  RQ1. Why does a university choose a particular business strategy?
";;;;;;;Additionally, Krimsky et al. (1991)  focus on academic and corporate ties in biotechnology and fear that involving universities in  entrepreneurial activities could affect research agenda, scientific norms of communication,  leading to conflicts of interest. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The  findings show how considering IC in the context of an ecosystem can include a wider set of  ICs that relate to the role universities play in the triple helix (Secundo et al., 2018).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; These universities can facilitate the exchange  of staff to improve organisational performance “by universally imposing culturally-specific  quality and accreditation standards and by transferring so-called ‘best practice’ from one  country to another” (Pearce, 2016, p. 44). Similarly, Powell (2014) focusses on the positive  knowledge effect that multinational universities can have in local communities, providing  new insights and importing knowledge into developing countries through international  experiences. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" Contingency factors, such as historical and  economic reasons, answer the “why” dimension of the framework and justify the  university’s chosen strategy. Thus, our findings build on the literature on university’s  strategies (Mintzberg and Rose, 2003) using a contingent approach that highlights the role  universities play in the ecosystem (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 2000).
";;"In a cross-sectional study, Ayoubi and Massoud (2007) report that several UK universities  claim to be pursuing an internationalisation process in their institutional mission statements  with international branches to serve a worldwide audience. While internationalisation and  globalisation are key elements in most university mission statements, the connection with  the local context is paramount to ensure the effectiveness of the triple helix (Pineda, 2015).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"4.1.2 The “who” dimension. Bari’s internal and external stakeholders are listed  in Table III.
Bari’s main internal stakeholders are professors and researchers, its strategic task force,  employees and administrative offices, and national and international students. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"To show the diversified approach, we identify contingency factors, such as historical and  economic reasons, in the “why” dimension of the framework to justify university decisions.
For example, the University of Bari developed a diversified strategy due to its perceived role  in shaping cultural values and supporting the broader development of society. These  findings build on findings concerning the benefits of diversification strategies (Mintzberg  and Rose, 2003). We outline how different approaches increase the university’s effectiveness  and efficiency (Agasisti, 2016). Additionally, our findings support the development of a  contingency approach that highlights the role that universities play in the triple helix  context to explain a university’s strategy (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 2000).
";;"The limitations of the paper derive from the analysis of only one exploratory case study in  the public sector in Italy. Future research might apply Secundo et al.’s (2016) framework to  other entrepreneurial universities in different countries to help understand their particular  strategies. Additionally, different models can be applied to extend our findings.

Lorio 2017 - The importance of pro-social behaviour for the breadth and depth of knowledge transfer activities;The importance of pro-social behaviour for the breadth and depth of  knowledge transfer activities: An analysis of Italian academic  scientists;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Governments at regional,  national and international levels consider the “entrepreneurial  university” as having an important role to play in the economic  development of their region via knowledge transfer (KT) to the  industrial sector (Etzkowitz et al., 2000; Etzkowitz, 2003).
Although existing studies have recognised that KT activities can  take multiple forms (Perkmann et al., 2013; Landry et al., 2007,  2010; D’Este and Patel, 2007; Siegel et al., 2007), most of the stud�ies to date have focused on speciffc types of KT activities, mainly  patenting, spin-offs and licensing (Azoulay et al., 2009; Thursby";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Funding Additional resources for basic research 0.8614 0.0028 0.1287 0.5084 0.0285 0.1667 0.7003 0.015 0.1343  Further resources for the research team 0.8024 0.2102 0.183 0.9741 0.1896 0.1233 0.702 0.2073 0.1817;;"The main independent variables refer to academics’ motiva�tion to engage with the non-academic environment: (i) acquisition  of new knowledge for future research (Learning); (ii) broadening  of the university mission (Mission) and (iii) funding new research  activity (Funding). The three variables are built from responses to  the following question contained in the survey: “Please rank the  following motivations to engage with the non-academic environ�ment according to their level of importance.” The respondents were  asked to rank the importance of each item on a four-point Likert  scale, ranging from “not important” to “highly important.”";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"(Informal relational activities). The two main dependent variables  are then created following D’Este and Patel(2007)in their construc�tion of the alternative measures of variety of University–industry  interactions (Variety 1 and Variety 2) and the construction of  knowledge breadth and depth variables by Laursen and Salter  (2006). This is done to incorporate two important dimensions in the  KT process: (i) the number of different mechanisms through which  KT is implemented (Variety 1 in the language of D’Este and Patel  or knowledge breadth for Laursen and Salter) and (ii) the relative  importance and extent of adoption of some mechanisms over oth�ers (Variety 2 for D’Este and Patel and knowledge depth for Laursen  and Salter).Any measure of KT focused only on a subset ofthe above  is likely to produce an incomplete picture of the phenomenon. For  instance, focusing only on the number of different KT mechanisms  can be an inadequate measure of KT if the different mechanisms  are very similar or if one mechanism is very frequent and the rest  extremely infrequent (D’Este and Patel, 2007).

Most universities around the world  have createdfacilities speciffcallydevotedto the commercialisation  of academic inventions, such as science parks, technology transfer  offfces and incubators (Hsu et al., 2015). ";"A  number of studies have thus considered a broader set of KT  activities, focusing on academics’ propensity to undertake them  (Ramos-Vielba et al., 2016; Olmos-Penuela ˜ et al., 2014; D’Este and  Perkmann, 2011; Landry et al., 2010; Grimpe and Fier, 2010; D’Este  and Patel, 2007; Link et al., 2007) and their relative effects (Landry  et al., 2007; D’Este et al., 2013; Sánchez-Barrioluengo, 2014). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;As discussed in section 2, we are interested in examining the  relationship between motivation to engage in KT activities and the  different forms through which this interaction can be realised (KT  breadth), as well as the intensity with whichKT activities are carried  out (KT depth);;;;;;"The questions  concerned information on individual characteristics, motivations  for and obstacles to carrying out KT activities and a full set of  detailed mechanisms through which scientists interact with exter�nal agents.

As a starting point, each activity is coded as a binary  variable, with 0 being no use and 1 being use of the given mecha�nism. Subsequently, the activities are simply added up so that each  scientist receives a 0 when no activity is realised and 13 when all  of the activities are realised. This measure has a good degree of  internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.75).;KT depth is deffned as the intensity with which scientists engage  in the different types of KT activities. Accordingly, KT depth is con�structed using the same 13 activities as those used in constructing  KT breadth. In this case, each of the activities is coded as 1 when the  scientist in question reports that he/she uses the activity to a high  degree (i.e., 6 or more times in the period 2004–2008) and 0 oth�erwise. As in the former case, the 13 mechanisms are subsequently  added up, so that each scientist receives a score of 0 when no mech�anisms are frequently used and a score of 13 when all of the KT  mechanisms are used to a high degree (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.65).5;"Mission, Learning and Funding are the key explanatory  variables; Zi is a vector of scientist-speciffc control variables; and  ε1,i and ε2,i are the error terms.

Ludwig Bstieler (2014) - Trust Formation in University–Industry Collaborations in the U.S. Biotechnology Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The hypotheses are tested with survey data from U.S.
ffrms active in UI research collaborations in the biotech�nology industry. A company list obtained from the Lexis�Nexis Research database complemented by the directory  of the Biotechnology Industry Association contained 660  ffrms with their biotech research dedicated to the life  sciences.
Preliminary informants in each ffrm were contacted by  phone and instructed in detail about the survey. The ulti�mate key informants were carefully identiffed and  screened. These typically were the chief scientists or  CEOs of the respective dedicated biotechnology  company. To control for common method bias, the survey  was split into two parts. The ffrst part contained questions  related to the independent and control variables, whereas  the second part, which was sent out upon return of the  ffrst part, contained the dependent variables. Moreover,  normative wording such as “trust” or “success” was  avoided in the survey instrument to minimize the poten�tial for social desirability bias among respondents.
All 660 ffrms were contacted by phone. One third of  the ffrms reported no UI collaboration within the prior 3  years and was excluded from further consideration. Of  the remaining 440 ffrms, 112 key informants provided  responses from as many biotechnology companies in the  life sciences, resulting in a response rate of 25.5%. Seven  responses with missing data were excluded, resulting in a  ffnal sample of 105 complete responses.
The unit of analysis for this study is the most recent UI  research collaboration project, completed within the last  3 years, which involved R&D of a new product or  technology.
Characteristics of the sample ffrms are summarized in  Table 1. The ffrms have a median number of 40 employ�ees, a median R&D workforce of 12 full-time equiva�lents, and a medium age of 11 years. Eighty-one percent  of the sample ffrms are SMEs with less than 500 employ�ees. Overall, the sample mostly contains young research�intensive ffrms which are typical for the biotechnology  industry. It broadly covers dedicated biotechnology ffrms  from all regions of the United States. Moreover, 71.2% of  all UI champions in the sample hold executive positions  in their companies.

";;;;;;;" Trust  can be deffned as a psychological state comprising the  intention to accept vulnerability based upon one party’s  positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of  another party in situations that are interdependent or risky  (Morgan and Hunt, 1994; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, and  Camerer, 1998).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;IP policies are deffned as rules and measures set up by  universities to protect IP created by university research�ers, maximize revenues, and facilitate knowledge transfer  (Santoro and Bierly, 2006).;Shared governance is deffned as the degree to which  the collaboration partners share the responsibility for  maintaining the collaboration itself and for jointly  responding to problems that arise as the project goes on  (Heide and Miner, 1992). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Trust has been found to serve as the glue that cements UI  collaborations and creates a climate that facilitates joint  activities and positive outcomes (Gopalakrishnan and  Santoro, 2004). When sharing project and problem�solving responsibilities, collaboration partners will be  better able to understand and absorb knowledge from  each other (Saxton, 1997).;"Here, a UI champion is deffned as “an individual who  is intensely interested and involved with the overall  objectives and goals of the project and who plays a domi�nant role in many of the research-engineering interaction  events through some of the stages, overcoming technical  and organizational obstacles, and pulling the effort  through its ffnal achievement by the sheer force of his or  her will and energy” (Chakrabarti, 1974, p. 58). The  industry champion has been found to be more critical to  the collaboration than the university champion (Santoro  and Chakrabarti, 2002).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Governance mechanisms in UI collaborations are nec�essary to clarify initial collaboration conditions, facilitate  the agreement between parties to perform particular  actions, allow adjustments to technological and market  changes, and in general to reduce behavioral uncertainty  (Gopalakrishnan and Santoro, 2004). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"University–industry (UI) collaborations for the  research and development (R&D) of new prod�ucts and technologies are an increasingly  important way in which ffrms can obtain, combine, and  leverage their R&D resources (Leydesdorff and Meyer,  2006; Sherwood and Covin, 2008). Because of a reduc�tion of industrial basic research laboratories both in  number and size, industry has come to rely increasingly  on academic laboratories for research output. At the same  time, productive and well-established research relations  with industry are important for those universities seeking  to possess a vibrant and dynamic research enterprise";;;;;"Independent variables. IP policies were assessed with  a four-item scale adapted from Santoro and Bierly  (2006), capturing the extent to which the university part�ner’s IP policies were clear, ffexible, and equitable, and  the IP offfce was helpful in matters of technology transfer.
Shared governance was measured with ffve items adapted  from Heide and Miner (1992) that assess the extent to  which the collaboration partners conducted joint plan�ning, joint evaluation of the UI project, jointly agreed on  project adjustments, and shared responsibility for the  project.

the UI champion overcame obstacles, did not give up  when faced with opposition, got the right individuals  involved, and got problems related to the collaboration  into the hands of those who can solve them. This four�item scale was based on Howell, Shea, and Higgins  (2005).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Convergent validity is examined by means of Cronbach’s  alphas and composite reliabilities (Appendix). All  Cronbach’s alphas (except for knowledge transfer) and  all composite reliabilities are > .70, a benchmark for reli�ability (Hulland, 1999; Nunnally, 1978). The average  variance extracted (AVE) and the square roots of each  AVE are calculated to test for discriminant validity, as  suggested by Fornell and Larcker (1981). The AVE  exceeds .50 in all cases. The square roots of the AVE for  each construct exceed the correlations between these and  other variables (Table 2). Furthermore, a common factor  analysis of all items related to the main variables of the  study (IP policies, shared governance, champion behav�ior, trust, knowledge transfer, innovation performance)  settles on a six factor solution with all loadings > .50 and  all cross loadings < .40. Taken together, the scales have  satisfactory convergent and discriminant validity (Fornell  and Larcker, 1981).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" The ffndings suggest that despite widely reported industry concerns over the control of IP, UI  research partners can develop a trustful environment and thereby plant the seeds for a successful collaboration. In  order to enhance trust, companies should not only consider university IP policies, but also need to actively engage in  shared governance with university partners. UI collaboration champions can help shift the attention of company  managers from formal rules set by university IP policies toward shared project planning, coordination, and imple�mentation with university partners.
";;"This study is based on the analysis of perceptions of one  side of the UI collaboration only (the industry perspec�tive), and on a single response for each collaboration.
Attempts were made to collect the names of partnering  universities. However, managers were extremely reluc�tant to provide such information. Thus, collecting dyadic  data proved to be infeasible. Instead, by making an  intense effort to identify the right informants and instruct  them carefully on taking the survey, the quality of  responses was maximized.
Survey data based on responses from single infor�mants are potentially subject to common method bias.
Various tactics regarded as effective remedies to control  for such a bias (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and  Podsakoff, 2003) were taken, but its existence cannot be  strictly ruled out.
Moreover, as this study is based on one-time observa�tions, its potential in capturing the dynamics of UI col�laborations over time is limited.
";;"borations over time is limited.
Given the contributions and limitations of this study,  further research on the role of interorganizational gover�nance mechanisms in UI collaborations in general and on  the role of innovation champions in particular appear to  be promising. Qualitative research based on case studies  may complement this survey-based study.

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Effective collaboration between university and industry can take various forms  (Westnes et al., 2009). D’Este and Perkmann (2011) separate university–industry  collaborations into three forms: collaborative research, contract research and  consulting. This study focuses on adjunct professors who are appointed at  university departments to undertake collaborative research. As Fagrell et al. (2016)  have shown, such appointees sometimes also engage in education and development  projects. De Fuentes and Dutre´nit (2012) analysed the interaction between  university and industry in three stages: drivers, channels and beneffts. Depending  on the drivers for interaction involved, there are various channels available and  these channels lead to different beneffts. The three-stage model that De Fuentes and  Dutre´nit used was inspired by the work of Cre´pon et al. (1998), who look at the  correlation of research investments at the ffrm level and at innovation and  productivity.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"To analyse and present the material for the ffrst question, concerning the  preconditions explaining the appointment of adjunct professors at universities, we  will depart from the analytical framework presented by Perkmann et al. (2013).
This framework speciffes organisational, individual and institutional factors  affecting the likelihood of university–industry collaboration. Organisational factors  include the research quality at the academics’ department or university, group-level  norms, formal support structures and afffliation with research centres. In a  qualitative study like this, however, it is appropriate to concentrate on only a few of  the factors. On the organisational level, we will focus on structures for support,  formal incentives and leadership rather than on university and department quality.
Quality of scientiffc production at the university and department level is better  illustrated in a comparative study using several cases. On an individual level, we  will focus on attitudes and motivations rather than productivity, age and gender.
Scientiffc productivity, age and gender demonstrate well-established correlations,  and there is little reason to question their validity regarding this channel of  collaboration. Attitudes and motivations are also more suitably illustrated by a  qualitative study. The institutional factors covered by Perkmann et al. (2013) are  disciplinary afffliation and national policy, both of which we will discuss.

MZ then con�ducted searches in MEDLINE, ABI/Inform, ERIC and  PsychInfo using search terms including, but not limited  to “translational medical research” or “community-based;;;;;;;;;The scoping step involved browsing to identify different  research traditions, or fields of study, and consulting  with experts to support decision-making about which  traditions to include. The literature was identified using  an iterative process that yielded studies of partnership  initiation. First, MZ searched the healthcare literature on  partnerships to gain an understanding of the topic and  begin conceptualising partnership initiation. This in�cluded sources known to the research team, including a  review [9], books [2, 20], concept papers [1, 3, 12], evalu�ations of the CLARHCs [7, 15, 21, 22] and Academic  Collaborative Centres [23], and a MEDLINE search for  researcher and research user partnership literature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" The goal of a meta-narrative review is sense�making; it seeks to identify, understand and describe  relevant narratives, and synthesise and compare them in  an over-arching narrative [19]. A meta-narrative is for�mally defined as a relatively new method of systematic  review, designed for topics that have been conceptua�lised and studied in different ways by different groups of  researchers [19]. The first part of a meta-narrative re�view involves seeking out different research traditions,  or fields of study, and collect data that describes how a  concept, in this case partnership initiation, was concep�tualised [19]. In this study, the ‘narrative’ refers to how  the idea of partnership initiation was conceptualised in  each research tradition by noting terms used to describe  initiation and the overall approach to partnership initi�ation, specifically the processes, barriers and enablers of  initiation. The steps of a meta-narrative review include  scoping the literature, searching for and selecting docu�ments, and data extraction, analysis and synthesis [19].
A meta-narrative review is meant to be an iterative  process, whereby steps such as searching or data extrac�tion are modified prospectively as a deeper understand�ing of the topic is gained. We adhered to the following  guiding principles of meta-narrative reviews: pragmatism  (by exploring partnership initiation in a variety of tradi�tions), pluralism (by considering studies of various de�signs included in reviews of different types), contestation  (by comparing data from different traditions to generate  higher-order insights), reflexivity (by documenting re�flective insights and decisions) and peer review (by pub�lishing and sharing the findings) [19]. We did not  employ a theoretical orientation; instead, as is commonly  done in meta-narrative reviews, we reported concepts,  theories and descriptions as reported reviews in each re�search tradition. However, those details were compiled  in narratives for each tradition, then compared across  traditions and finally consolidated in a conceptual  framework, which serves as early theory of IKT initi�ation. We used the Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence  Syntheses: Evolving Standards (RAMESES) reporting  standards [19] (Additional file 1).

Maribel Guerrero (2020) - Entrepreneurial university ecosystems and graduates’ career patterns;Entrepreneurial university  ecosystems and graduates’ career  patterns: do entrepreneurship  education programmes and  university business  incubators matter?;;;;;;;;;;;"Based on previous studies [5], this research uses the database from the ITESM’s 2011–2013  Professional Trajectory of ITESM Graduates Survey [6].

(2002), the central premise of the expectancy theory is that behaviours are a function of  individuals’ expectations based on the perceived value of their achievements (e.g. if their set  of skills/abilities are adequate or not), the particular level of performance (e.g. if their  outcomes are motivated to their performance) and the attractiveness of the reward (e.g.
valence and personal goals relationship). Under this perspective, individuals seek to  maximise their utility from their job choices (Douglas and Shepherd, 2002), and it will be  influenced by their perceived desirability (Krueger et al., 2000).

Figure 1 shows the proposed dimensions of  this function linked to the influence of entrepreneurial university (H1 and H2) and individual  motivations (H3 and H4).
";;;;;;;"An  entrepreneurial university is understood as a university which simultaneously fulfils three  core activities – teaching, research and entrepreneurship – while providing an adequate  atmosphere in which the university community can explore/exploit ideas (Guerrero, 2008;  Guerrero and Urbano, 2012) for contributing into the socio-economic transformation of cities/  regions/countries (Grimaldi et al., 2011; Urbano and Guerrero, 2013; Guerrero et al., 2015;  Klofsten et al., 2019; Audretsch et al., 2019).

";;;;;;;;;;;"H4. Graduates’ academic entrepreneurs are more likely to demand higher income, lower  than self-employed but higher than paid employees.
";;;;;;;"Conceptually, ecosystems involve a set of individuals,  organisations, industries and environmental elements such as leadership, dynamic  capabilities, culture, capital markets, networks and open-minded customers that combine  in complex ways (Acs et al., 2018; Audretsch et al., 2019). In the university context,  entrepreneurial innovation university ecosystems are integrated by educational  programmes, infrastructures (incubators, research parks, technology transfer offices,  business creation offices, employment offices), university regulations (business creation  normative, property rights), university culture (role models, attitudes towards  entrepreneurship) as well as relationships with government, investors, industry and other  socio-economic agents (Guerrero and Urbano, 2012, 2019a; Herrera et al., 2018, 2019b;  Nicholls-Nixon et al., 2020; van Rijnsoever, 2020). This ecosystem supports the university  community (students, alumni, academics, staff) in the identification, development and  commercialisation of innovative and entrepreneurial initiatives (Grimaldi et al., 2011;  Guerrero et al., 2017, 2018). The analysis of these inter-connections is relevant because both  ecosystems regulate the nature and the quality of entrepreneurial activity by shaping  rewards linked to opportunity identification/generation and pursuit of organisational forms/  strategies (Wrightet al., 2017). In this assumption, the following section explores the influence  of the element of entrepreneurial universities ecosystems on graduates’ career choices.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Carter et al. (2003) explored  several reasons that individuals give for starting a business-like innovation, independence,  recognition, roles, financial success and self-realisation. They evidenced that, in comparison  with no entrepreneurs, nascent entrepreneurs have a similar impact on the majority of those  reasons, but a few differences associated with roles, recognition, and gender perspectives.
However, these differences/similitudes will be noted when the utility-maximising function is  introduced.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" Career options  vary according to their level of risk. Kihlstrom and Laffont (1979) suggested that more risk�averse individuals become employees and more risk tolerance individuals become academic  entrepreneurs. In this assumption, while an employee typically receives a salary/wage,  self-employment typically represents a riskier endeavour (Knight, 1921). Positive tolerance  for risk may expand the effort and variance of earnings (Douglas and Shepherd, 2000). In the  context of the entrepreneurial university, an increased number of studies have identified that  incubators are adequate university supports across the entrepreneurial and innovation  process (Barbero et al., 2014; McAdam and McAdam, 2008). A university incubator provides  access to invaluable resources/networks (Aaboen, 2009; Ebbers, 2014) and knowledge/  technology from university (Rothaermel and Thursby, 2005a,2005b; Good et al., 2019).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The dependent variable was measured with a categorical that captures the current career  choices of ITESM’s graduates: (1) academic entrepreneur who has created, organised, and  operated an entrepreneurial initiative like a spin-off or technological-based venture taking  higher risks in order to do so, (2) self-employed who has worked for oneself as a freelancer and  (3) paid employee who has been employed by an employer to develop specific tasks in an  established organisation.;;;"We included a set of independent variables associated with the university influence on  work effort and risk aversion, as well as individuals’ motivations of independence and income  expectations. Regarding the entrepreneurial university influence, we introduced work effort  associated with the skills and capabilities acquired by the graduates during their studies at  the university. Based on extant studies (Arenius and Minnitti, 2005; Davidsson; Honig, 2003;  Martiarena, 2013; Parker, 2004; Nabi et al., 2017), we selected the skills/abilities associated to  the generation of ideas, work under uncertainty, auto-learning and ethics.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" Our results show the critical role of entrepreneurial universities ecosystems in facilitating  employability options as academic entrepreneurship for ITESM’s graduates. The study shows some insights  about how graduates’ risk aversion and work effort are positively influenced by the university business  incubator and entrepreneurship education programs, respectively.
";;"We acknowledge that this study has several limitations:. First, similar to previous studies,  the critical challenge is the access to longitudinal information (i.e. Douglas and Shepherd, 2002  used a sample of 300 graduates of one university between two to ten years after graduation  from the business degree). In this study, we explored the occupational patterns of different  graduates (from diverse bachelor’s degrees) of a multi-campus entrepreneurial university  located in diverse regions of Mexico. Although our insights are only applicable within our  research setting, this paper should explore in detail the influence on graduates’ occupational  decisions of diversity in terms of multiple generational cohorts (Guerrero et al., 2019a) and  multiple regional contexts (Guerrero and Urbano, 2019a). Each generation has particularities in  terms of their backgrounds, skills and attitudes that should be revised, as well as each  university’s campus has particularities in terms of leadership, resources/capabilities, regional  regulations and cultural backgrounds towards academic entrepreneurship.
Second, although our proxies have been used in extant studies, it is essential to explore  new dimensions to measure the graduates’ determinants of academic entrepreneurship.
Given the nature of the data set, we applied multinomial regression analysis. The complexity  behind the determinants of graduates’ occupational choices demands the use of robust  variables and longitudinal data sets to understand this phenomenon (Guerrero et al., 2018) as  well as the dynamism of the ecosystems’ life cycle (Cantner et al., 2020). It also implies the  improvement of the statistical analysis by implementing other techniques (i.e. panel data,  structural equation modelling, experiments) as well as complementing the utility-maximising  model with other theoretical frameworks (e.g. institutional economic theory, stakeholder  theory, generational cohorts approach, spillover theory).
Third, we intuitively captured the effectiveness of micro-level conditions at an  entrepreneurial university. We are assuming the same value-added of the entrepreneurial  university ecosystem for all graduates across all campuses (Peters et al., 2004; Guerrero et al.,  2018). However, given the limitations of our data set, we did not test the effectiveness and the  success of entrepreneurship education programmes and business incubators. A natural  extension of this study should measure the effectiveness and success/failure at micro-level of  academic entrepreneurship. It implies a mixed longitudinal approach that allows capturing  objective as well as subjective measures for a better understanding of this phenomenon. It is  also aligned with the academic debate about the lack of studies concerning strategic  knowledge management models for entrepreneurial universities (Guerrero et al., 2019b and  Secundo et al., 2019), as well as understanding the technological, economic and societal  contribution of entrepreneurial ecosystems (Audretsch et al., 2019).
Fourth, our findings explored how the university has configured its entrepreneurship  ecosystem for supporting academic entrepreneurship. However, this study does not explore  the influence/impacts generated by regional entrepreneurial ecosystems on the university  ecosystem";;"A future research avenue will be  focused on exploring the contribution of regional entrepreneurship ecosystems to  university’s infrastructures like incubators (Nicholls-Nixon et al., 2020; van Rijnsoever,  2020). It requires a multilevel analysis using both university and regional data";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(2) Do inter�personal ties enhance the interaction quality and outcomes of research collaborations  in Korea, in particular when compared with the role of inter-organizational tie strength?
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In business research, the concept of tie strength, defined as the degree of closeness  between collaboration partners through past interactions (Granovetter, 1973; Marsden  & Campbell, 1984), has been frequently applied to the inter-organizational level,  suggesting that as a result of past interactions, representatives of collaborating firms  feel collectively close to each other (Ring & Van de Ven, 1994). In other words, the  concept of informal social ties between individuals (inter-personal ties) has been  transposed to the strength of ties between whole organizations (inter-organizational  tie strength). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"For the survey of NPD collaborations, data have been collected from firms with 50  or more employees in the Korean machinery and electronics industries. From the  M. Hemmert
Korean Machinery Directory and the Electronics Industry Directory, initial lists of 541  machinery companies and 835 electronics firms were extracted. All these firms were  contacted by phone, and those firms that were not manufacturing firms, did not exist  anymore, could not be reached, did not develop any new products, or did not have any  recent NPD collaborations were removed from the lists. As a result of this screening  process, 165 machinery firms and 147 electronics firms with NPD collaborations  remained in the sample.
A key informant who had to be intimately involved in the collaboration effort and  typically was a NPD project manager was identified for each firm. Key informants were  carefully instructed over the phone about the survey content and requested to respond  on the most recent NPD collaboration within the last three years with an external,  independent partner firm. Collaborations with member firms of the same business  group were excluded from consideration. Questionnaires were sent out and responses  were collected via email attachment. In total, 126 responses were received, yielding a  response rate of 40.3% of the firm population with NPD collaborations. 24 responses  were discarded because of missing data on key variables, resulting in a final sample of  102 collaborations, among which 49 were conducted by machinery firms and 53 by  electronics firms.
The NPD collaboration sample includes firms from a wide range of sub�classifications within the machinery and electronics industries. Most of the participating  firms are small to medium-sized with a median of 125 employees and annual sales of  22 billion Korean Won (roughly equivalent to 20 million US$). The majority of the  collaborations were conducted with customer firms (54%), followed by supplier firms  (22%), and other partners, mostly venture firms (24%).
In the UIC survey, data were collected from Korean firms active in UICs in the  microelectronics, software, and biotechnology industries. Initially, a list of 5536  firms with 10 or more employees was extracted from the Directory of Microelec�tronic and Information Companies, the Directory of Bioventure Companies, and a  list of companies participating in UICs obtained from the Korea Association of  Industry, Academy and Research Institute. For all these firms, a preliminary  informant—usually the director of R&D, marketing, new product development,  or new business development—was identified and contacted by phone to inquire  about whether a UIC has been completed within the last three years. Through this  process, 1784 firms with recent UICs were identified. Next, key informants were  identified with the assistance of the preliminary informant. These key informants  were contacted by phone and surveys were sent out and collected by email,  following the same procedure as in the NPD survey. 315 responses were received  in total, resulting in a response rate of 17.7%. Since 28 of these responses were  incomplete, they were removed from the subsequent analysis, resulting in a final  sample of 287 complete responses (57 from the biotechnology industry, 116 from  the microelectronics industry, and 114 from the software industry).
The UIC sample consists to a great extent of relatively young and research  active small to medium-sized companies. More than 90% of the firms have less  than 100 employees. The average firm size is 43.6 employees and the average firm  age 9.8 years.
";;;;;;Inter-personal ties Informal social ties are measured using five categorical variables  partially adapted from Yee (2000), applying yes/no questions on whether the following  types of inter-personal ties between representatives of the focal firms and representa�tives of partner organizations existed prior to the formation of the collaboration or not:  (1) family ties, (2) school/university network ties, (3) regional network ties, (4) industry  network ties, and (5) other inter-personal ties.;;;;;;;"Inter-organizational tie strength The strength of inter-organizational ties is gauged  through a three-item construct inspired by Granovetter (1973) on the closeness and  stability of the relationship and the number of collaborations conducted with the partner  prior to the focal collaboration. The scale has a Cronbach’s alpha of .68 for NPD  collaborations and of .73 for UICs.
";;;;;"Collaboration outcomes Two dimensions of collaboration outcomes are considered:  knowledge acquisition and project performance. Knowledge acquisition, defined as the  degree of information acquired via the collaboration that extends a firm’s knowledge  base about new product development, and production and manufacturing processes, is  M. Hemmert
a major objective in research collaborations (Rindfleisch & Moorman, 2001). It is  measured by three items adapted from Lynn, Skov, and Abel (1999) on the acquisition  of information about new products, new manufacturing processes and personal prac�tices. The scale has a Cronbach’s alpha of .73 for NPD collaborations and of .89 for  UICs. Project performance is defined as the extent to which collaboration goals are met  and is measured through a scale adapted from Saxton (1997) which covered five items  on the fulfillment of expectations and objectives of the UIC, the extent to which the  collaboration was perceived as beneficial and productive, and the motivation to do  more projects with the same partner. The scale’s Cronbach’s alpha is .89 for NPD  collaborations and .94 for UICs.";;"Interaction quality The quality of interaction between collaboration partners is  assessed through two constructs: communication quality and trust. Communication  quality, defined as the quality of formal and informal sharing of meaningful and timely  information between collaboration partners (Anderson & Narus, 1990), was measured  using four items on the timeliness, reliability, adequacy and completeness of the  communication between collaboration partners. The items were adapted from Mohr  and Spekman (1994); the Cronbach’s alpha of this composite measure was .92 for NPD  collaborations and .95 for UICs. Trust, defined as a psychological state to accept  vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the partner’s intentions in situations  that are interdependent or risky (Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, &  Camerer, 1998), was measured using four items based on a scale adapted from Ganesan  (1994). The items measured perceived honesty, caring, and reliability of promises  made. The scale has a Cronbach’s alpha of .88 for NPD collaborations and of .93 for  UICs.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The items were adapted from Mohr  and Spekman (1994); the Cronbach’s alpha of this composite measure was .92 for NPD  collaborations and .95 for UICs. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This study on inter-organizational research collaborations in Korea reveals overall  similar results across the two types being studied (NPD collaborations and UICs) and  partially unexpected findings. First, inter-personal ties between representatives of  organizations engaged in research collaborations are widely prevalent in Korea—they  have been found in a majority of NPD collaborations and UICs. ;;"This research has some limitations. It relies on information provided by a single key  informant for each research collaboration, as it turned out to be difficult to obtain  multiple responses from the mostly small R&D teams of the surveyed firms. Instead,  the quality of responses was maximized through the careful selection of key informants  and the careful instruction of these key informants about the survey.
A number of remedies have been employed to minimize the potential for common  method variance, as suggested by Podsakoff et al. (2003). However, its existence  cannot be strictly ruled out.
The potential of cross-sectional studies to capture the dynamic interaction between  partner organizations in inter-organizational research collaborations is limited. Further�more, as this research has followed the approach of measuring inter-personal ties in  Korea in a categorical sense, potential differences in the strength and quality of these  ties were not considered.
Finally, the findings of this research partially rely on correlation analysis. As  statistical correlation is not equivalent to causality, some caution is needed regarding  the interpretation of results.
";;Given the contributions and limitations, there are several promising research ave�nues for further studies on the relevance of inter-personal ties for research collabora�tions and other innovation-related business activities. Case study and longitudinal study  designs may be employed to verify the results of this exploratory study and further  advance our understanding of the role of inter-personal ties in these business activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

More specifically, this involves  creating university spin-offs, conducting licensing, generating research contracts, providing  consulting services and facilitating the mobility of graduate students and researchers  throughout these sectors (Elia et al., 2017; Vaz de Almeida et al., 2018).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Given that the current study aimed to investigate interorganizational relationships, a  qualitative research approach was selected as this is useful in exploratory research and  allows network actors to think freely about the topic under study (Yin, 2015). The  intersubjective relationships between interviewers and interviewees are a central feature of  qualitative interviews, since these connections facilitate the negotiation of visions of reality  based on the dynamics between participants. In general, all methods should seek to find  answers – whether positive or negative – to at least four requirements of empirical research:  construct validity, external validity, internal validity and confidence in results (Yin, 2015).
Interviews are one of the most common methods used in small-scale research. In  semi-structured interviews, the interviewer establishes a general structure, deciding in  advance the terrain to be covered and the main issues to be addressed. A more detailed  structure is elaborated during the interview, and the interviewee has a reasonable degree of  freedom regarding what to talk about, how much to say and how to express it (Minichiello  et al., 2008). Semi-structured interviews are thus an extremely flexible technique appropriate  for studies with a limited scope (Drever, 1995).
The qualitative approach further fully acknowledges the challenge of doing original  research and pursuing three important goals: transparency, method and adherence to  evidence (Yin, 2015). More specifically, a case study is a type of research that examines  people, programs or institutions in their real situation via interviews, observations,  documents, questionnaires and artefacts (Yin, 2015). In the present research, the case study  was Portugal’s GAPIs.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" The purpose of this paper is to examine how important technology transfer offices (TTOs) – which  in Portuguese are called “industrial property support offices” or GAPIs – are in terms of fostering patent  applications and technology transfer in countries characterized by low performance records in these activities.
";;;;;;;;;;;"RQ1. What is the importance of GAPIs in patent registration and knowledge/technology  transfer in a country with low IP protection?
";;;;;;;"These behaviors can be encouraged by applying numerous government stimuli, such as  tax policies, employment policies, subsidies, business education and IP policies (Lambert, 2003;  Cassia et al., 2014; Czarnitzki et al., 2015). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Following this, Stankeviciėnė et al. (2017) argue that more studies are needed to assess  technology transfer offices’ (TTOs’) importance to technology transfer between universities  and companies. In addition, Siegel and Wright (2015) and De Beer et al. (2017) report that  little evidence exists of TTOs’ effectiveness regarding technology transfer. ;;"National and regional governments have sought to encourage the transfer of university  technology to industries to sustain and develop national and regional economic systems,  thereby leveraging the “third component of their [universities’] mission” (Etzkowitz et al.,  2000; Laredo, 2007; Carayannis and Campbell, 2012; Kochenkova et al., 2016).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"More specifically, a case study is a type of research that examines  people, programs or institutions in their real situation via interviews, observations,  documents, questionnaires and artefacts (Yin, 2015).

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The results show that GAPIs play an important role in the innovation life-cycle, speeding up the  transfer of knowledge and technology to society. The regulation of intellectual property (IP) ownership and  royalty sharing with inventors was identified as a major result, strengthening entrepreneurial universities’  role. In addition, after the GAPIs were created, networks were formed that facilitate the sharing of knowledge  and experience and promote the development of further collaborative partnerships.
Practical implications – This study’s results offer new insights into how GAPIs contribute to socio�economic growth by fostering more entrepreneurial universities and increasing the transfer of technology to  society. In addition, these offices promote the creation of networks between GAPIs, enabling them to leverage  universities’ potential for participation in socio-economic development.
";;These limitations can be a starting point for future investigations. The present study  should be extended to include other countries to compare TTOs’ roles in different  socio-economic contexts. Another suggestion would be to study entrepreneurial  universities’ impacts on regional development and their contributions to the development  of innovation.;;Finally, further research is needed on the reasons why most patents are not  transferred to companies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Methods for assessing higher education research team collaboration comparing research outputs;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Co-authorship data  Team productivity was determined using aggregated research outputs for each  team, based upon all members (core, HDR and afffliate). Digital reporting templates  (a Microsoft Word format) were completed and submitted quarterly by team leaders.
The reports listed all research outcomes under sub-headings of activities (meetings,  publications, presentations, and grant applications/successes). A single research pro�gramme manager coordinated the process across teams to ensure quality and  consistency.
Social network analysis of research collaboration  The complete set of co-authorship data from research teams (i.e., all team outputs across  the life of the project) was subsequently prepared for SNA. This preparation involved stan�dardization of team member names (so that all references were identical), substitution of  names for codes (one code for each researcher), and construction of a graph from this  dataset using the Python NetworkX library (Hagberg, Swart, & Chult, 2008). A graph  was constructed for each team following the convention of co-authorship studies, treating  researchers as nodes in the graph and drawing undirected links between them (edges) for  each instance of a co-authored output. Quantitative network measures were extracted for  each graph using NetworkX functions (described in Results).
Survey of team members  An anonymous online survey explored participant perceptions of collaboration within  teams. The survey questioned researchers about the frequency of their collaboration and  their perceptions of how it impacted team productivity. The survey was conducted near  the end of the research project in late 2015. The survey included 13 questions: seven  multiple choice, four short answers, and two Likert scale. The survey had a low response";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Research policy; research  collaboration; research  evaluation; Australia;  bibliometric; science of team  science; social network  analysis";;;;;;;;;;; collaborative research teams;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Social network analysis of co-authorship  Team performance and structure were analysed using quantitative SNA measures  (Newman, 2003) to enable aspects of team structure to be compared, Table 4. The  number of nodes is indicative of the number of contributors to each research team.
Note that the number of nodes in a team’s graph differs from the number of researchers  in each team (Table 2), as it includes all contributors to research team outputs; for  example, a member from another team may have been a co-author on a paper. The  number of edges indicates the number of connections between these nodes. The average  degree is given by the average number of edges that connects to each node within the  network, that is, the number of edges divided by the number of nodes. Table 4 shows  the outcomes for key SNA measures.
The clustering co-efffcient for each node is the ratio of the links that a node has with  other nodes in the network divided by the maximum possible number of links to neigh�bours. It is a global measure (across the whole network) identifying a tight-knit commu�nity (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). Speciffcally, it indicates how many triangles within the  graph are closed (i.e., sets of three nodes that are connected by three edges) as a ratio com�pared to sets of three nodes that are connected by only two edges. Teams with a higher  clustering co-efffcient (closer to a value of one) have fewer ‘holes’ within the lattice of  the network; thus a value closer to one indicates a more tight-knit community. Teams  A and C have a higher clustering co-efffcient due to the presence of several tightly con�nected cliques on the network fringes.
The network centralization is a measure of the distribution of individuals’ centrality  within a graph, and three types of centralization were measured: betweenness, closeness,  and degree. Network centralization is established by ffrst measuring the individual central�ity for all nodes which is done respectively (Freeman, 1978; Newman, 2003) by: (a) calcu�lating the number of times a node sits on the shortest path between other nodes as  betweenness; (b), calculating average length of the shortest path between the node and  all other nodes in the graph as closeness; (c) counting the number of ties a node has to  neighbours as degree. The single measure of network centralization is then calculated as  the distribution of centrality using Freeman’s technique for normalization (1978) to  allow for comparison between graphs.1 Higher values for network centralization indicate  that a team has less distributed centrality. For example, if a team has a single central  researcher with a high centrality and many researchers who had low centrality then  network centralization would be high. For this reason it is a measure that may provide  evidence of collaboration within a team (Badar, Hite, & Badir, ";;;;"Opportunities for advancing knowledge about research collaboration  There is a limitation in the present study that whilst many conditions were controlled  between teams (funding, location, governance, timeframe, milestones, etc.), other con�ditions were not controlled, such as prior research experience of the team members and  the size of the teams. Whilst this lack of perfect control limits the signiffcance of the  results, it is an important element of the argument being made in this article: that due  to the infeasibility of laboratory conditions (e.g., for a large scale randomized control  trial involving serious research funding) there is a need to move towards large aggregate  datasets that are composed of a set of imperfect studies (controlled in only some ways) and  that have sufffciently thick description to allow for future meta-analysis. Following Stokols  et al. (2008), this is a plausible way to advance the research agenda by moving in the direc�tion of quasi-experimental research that incorporates multiple comparison groups.
Research that requires controlled conditions and comparison between research teams  will typically be opportunistic in nature, reliant upon favourable circumstances in terms  of grant conditions or institutional arrangements. It is proposed that it is vital that research  managers within institutions be aware of the need for this kind of inter-team comparison  data so that when opportunity presents, they are aware of the potential for valuable  research.

Hypothesis 3b: The relationship between ffrm trust in the  URC and URC-ffrm knowledge transfer will be moderated  by the tacitness of the URC’s knowledge base, such that  the trust-knowledge transfer relationship will be stronger  for tacit knowledge than for explicit knowledge.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Our focus in this study is on a speciffc type of knowledge  acquisition, knowledge transfer from URC’s to ffrms. The ffow  of knowledge from URC’s to ffrms will increase in quality and  quantity if certain facilitators are in place to stimulate the knowl�edge transfer process. The rationale for our choice of facilitators  to study is guided by previous research on university-industry  partnerships, and is also based on prior research on strategic al�liances, joint ventures, network structures and intra-organiza�tional (e.g., across subsidiaries) knowledge transfer. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Knowledge can be classiffed  as explicit if it can be transferred from one individual to an�other using some type of formal communication system. Thus,  explicit knowledge must be articulable or codiffable. On the  other hand, tacit knowledge is generally viewed as knowledge  that cannot be formally communicated [46]. Tacit knowledge  is deeply rooted in one’s experience and own “mental model.”  The distinction between explicit and tacit knowledge is impor�tant when we evaluate competitive differences between ffrms.
Tacit knowledge is more valuable and more likely to lead to a  sustainable competitive advantage than explicit knowledge be�cause it is much harder for competitors to imitate [30], [71],  [73]. Inimitability is further increased when the knowledge is  complex and combined with other types of knowledge in an un�clear fashion; that is, there is causal ambiguity ";;;;;;;;;;;;;"The core assumptions of the knowl�edge-based view of the ffrm are: 1) an organization’s principal  function is to create, integrate, and apply knowledge; 2) sustain�able competitive advantages and performance differences result  when ffrms have unique knowledge bases based on the capa�bility to manage different knowledge areas ";;The knowledge-based view of the ffrm is a contemporary ap�proach to strategic management and organizational design that  has evolved over the last ten years from the broader approach to  strategy referred to as the resource-based view of the ffrm;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Data collection for this study followed Dillman’s [11]  Total Design Method (TDM). In line with the TDM, we ffrst  conducted a comprehensive review of the literature. We then  conducted ten in-depth interviews with senior executives in a  random sample of small to large ffrms in the targeted industries  to clarify our conceptual framework and obtain face validity to  our initial survey questionnaire.
";;;;;;Firm-URC Social Connectedness: Social contacts be�tween individuals at the URC and the ffrm will facilitate  knowledge transfer by providing the personal contacts that  can serve as the conduit for knowledge ffow. According to  Oliver and Liebeskind [43], most exchanges of new scientiffc  knowledge take place through interpersonal relations devel�oped through social contacts with individuals at other ffrms,  universities, and government agencies. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Control Variables  1) Firm Size: We controlled for ffrm size since prior studies  show ffrm size is consequential in industry-university collabo�rative ventures [54]. Firm size was measured by the ffrm’s total  number of employees. We obtained the ffrm’s total number of  employees from Research Insight. Since there was a wide varia�tion in the number of employees for the ffrms in this sample, i.e.,  ffrms ranged from having one employee to having over a hun�dred thousand employees, we therefore applied the logarithm to  the ffrm’s total number of employees.
2) Industrial Sector: We controlled for the ffrm’s indus�trial sector since prior research indicates industry-university";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Dependent Variable  1) Knowledge Transfer: We adapted Simonin’s [59]  three-item measure where our three items ( )  using seven-point Likert scales ( to  ) measured the extent of knowledge  transferred from the URC to the ffrm. We asked each ffrm,  based on the ffrm’s most recent experience with a URC within  the last three years, whether they agreed or disagreed with the  following statements: 1) the ffrm learned a great deal from  the university research center, 2) the knowledge held by the  university research center had been assimilated by the ffrm and  contributed to products/services developed by the ffrm, and 3)  the knowledge held by the university research center directly  resulted in new products and services offered to our customers.;;;;;"Independent Variables  1) Knowledge Explicitness: We adapted Simonin’s [59]  two-item measure where our two items ( ) using  seven-point Likert-type scales (  to ) measured the type of knowledge  transferred, i.e., explicit versus tacit. We asked each ffrm, based  on the ffrm’s most recent experience with a URC within the  last three years, whether they agreed or disagreed with the  following statements: 1) the URC’s knowledge was easily  codiffed into blueprints, instructions, formulas, etc., and 2) the  URC’s knowledge was more explicit than tacit. Scores closer to  one indicated the knowledge was more tacit while scores closer  to seven indicated the knowledge was more explicit.
2) Social Connectedness: We adapted Young-Ybarra  and Wiersema’s [72] two-item measure where our two  items ( ) using seven-point Likert-type scales  ( to ) measured the extent to  which the ffrm and URC had close interactions at the individual  level of the partnership. We asked each ffrm, based on the ffrm’s  most recent experience with a URC within the last three years,  the frequency that each of the following occurred: 1) number  of joint articles or conference presentations, and 2) number of  recent graduates or student interns hired by the ffrm.
3) Technology Transfer and Intellectual Property Poli�cies: Following NSB [40] and Thursby and Thursby [65],  our ffve-item measure ( ) using seven-point  Likert-type scales ( to  ) evaluated the university technology transfer  and intellectual property policies. We asked each ffrm, based  on the ffrm’s most recent experience with a URC within the last  three years, the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with  the following statements. 1) University intellectual property  policies are sufffciently ffexible to meet the ffrm’s needs, 2)  University intellectual property policies are clear and easily  understood, 3) University intellectual property policies are eq�uitable in revenue and royalty sharing, 4) University technology  transfer policies are adaptable to the ffrm’s line of business,  and 5) University technology transfer offfce is helpful with  technology transfer.
4) Trust: We adapted Saparito, Chen and Sapienza’s [55]  four-item measure where our four items ( ) using  seven-point Likert-type scales ( to  ) measured the ffrm’s trust in the uni�versity research center. We asked each ffrm, based on the ffrm’s  most recent experience with a URC within the last three years,  the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with each of the  following statements. 1) The ffrm can freely share their con�cerns and problems and know the URC will listen, 2) The URC  will understand our needs even if we do not describe them in  detail, 3) The ffrm can freely share conffdences and know the  URC will keep those conffdences, 4) The ffrm shares common  business values with the URC.
5) Technological Relatedness: Firms are often bounded in  generating new technologies and capabilities by ffnite resources  and limited technological expertise. Consequently, some ffrms  collaborate with university research centers in order to gain  access to needed knowledge and technologies, particularly  for advancing technologies central to the ffrm’s business [53],  [54]. We were therefore interested in the degree of techno�logical overlap of knowledge obtained externally from the  partnering URC to supplement and strengthen the ffrm’s tech�nological base. Thus, we adapted Santoro and Chakrabarti’s  [54] measure where our two items ( ) using  seven-point Likert-type scales ( to  ) measured the importance of the URC’s  technological base for supplementing and strengthening the  ffrm’s core technological base. We asked each ffrm, based on  the ffrm’s most recent experience with a URC within the last  three years, how important it was the ffrm 1) accessed expertise  from the URC to strengthen the ffrm’s core area of business,  and 2) accessed outside facilities from the URC to strengthen  the ffrm’s core area of business.
6) Technological Capability: We followed previous studies  on absorptive capacity by measuring technological capability as  R&D intensity [7], [16], [68] which is measured by the ffrm’s  R&D investment divided by the ffrm’s sales revenues. We ob�tained these data from Research Insight where technological ca�pability represented the industrial ffrm’s R&D investment for  the year 2002 divided by the industrial ffrm’s sales revenues for  the year 2002. The data were collected for the year 2002 since  the survey questionnaire was completed in the year 2002.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" An  analysis of nonresponse bias showed no signiffcant differences  between ffrms responding to the survey questionnaire compared  to those not responding based on ffrm size ( , ),  industrial sector ( , ), or ffrm location ( ,  ). There was no late-response bias; no signiffcant differ�ences are evident between ffrms responding in the ffrst mailing  compared to ffrms responding in the second mailing based on  ffrm size ( , ), industrial sector ( ),  or ffrm location ( , ).
";;;;;;;;;;;Thus, we adapted Santoro and Chakrabarti’s  [54] measure where our two items ( ) using  seven-point Likert-type scales ( to  ) measured the importance of the URC’s  technological base for supplementing and strengthening the  ffrm’s core technological base.;We adapted Simonin’s [59]  three-item measure where our three items ( )  using seven-point Likert scales ( to  ) measured the extent of knowledge  transferred from the URC to the ffrm;;;;;We adapted Young-Ybarra  and Wiersema’s [72] two-item measure where our two  items ( ) using seven-point Likert-type scales  ( to ) measured the extent to  which the ffrm and URC had close interactions at the individual  level of the partnership. ; Following NSB [40] and Thursby and Thursby [65],  our ffve-item measure ( ) using seven-point  Likert-type scales ( to  ) evaluated the university technology transfer  and intellectual property policies.;We adapted Saparito, Chen and Sapienza’s [55]  four-item measure where our four items ( ) using  seven-point Likert-type scales ( to  ) measured the ffrm’s trust in the uni�versity research center. ;;"Results indi�cate that social connectedness, trust, URC technology transfer-in�tellectual property policies, technological relatedness and techno�logical capability are signiffcant facilitators of knowledge transfer.
We also found that the type of knowledge transferred, i.e., explicit  versus tacit, moderated these relationships.";;A key limita�tion relates to our principal focus on the industrial ffrm. Since  collaborative ventures mean two or more partners, our concen�tration on the ffrm’s perspective limits the scope of our model.;;"Future work should also examine the key facilitators of knowl�edge transfer from the university research center’s perspective.
Investigations focusing on such things as URC and industrial  ffrm cultural and philosophical compatibility and the existence  of shared goals and objectives could offer additional insights.
Another notable limitation relates to the cross-sectional nature  of this study. While we have provided a description of a complex  phenomenon, our study does not demonstrate causality. Finally,  our dependent variable was the transfer of knowledge within  the context of industrial ffrms working with university research  centers. Certainly our measure of knowledge transfer does not  completely embody all the possibilities that exist. Future work  could incorporate additional indices that tap into a broader and  more ffne-grained array of knowledge and technological pro�cesses and outcomes that could extend our ffndings and further  advance ways industry-university partnerships can be used as a  key strategy for creating competitive advantage.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Prior Experience: We also controlled for the ffrm’s  prior experience with URC’s since prior research on strategic  alliances has shown that strategic alliances are more likely  to be successful if the ffrms involved have more experience  participating in partnerships [54], [67]. Similarly, we expect  that ffrms with past experience partnering with URC’s are more  successful because they learn through experience, including  activities associated with the knowledge transfer process. Prior  experience was measured using a continuous variable repre�senting relationships with a URC(s) prior to the partnership  being analyzed in this study. The ffrms in our sample ranged  from having zero prior relationships with URCs to having ffve  prior relationships with URCs.

Michael D. Santoro & Shanthi Gopalakrishnan (2020) - The institutionalization of knowledge transfer activities within industry–university;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"To better understand the dynamics of these I/U relationships,  two different sources of exploratory data were obtained. First, an analysis of 12 recent  NSF program evaluations and survey protocols were examined. Next, 15 semi-structured,  face-to-face and phone interviews were conducted with industrial ffrm representatives and  university center directors. The analysis of program evaluations and survey protocols along  with the interview data were used to clarify and substantiate our conceptual framework.
The interviews also served to reffne and provide face validity to the survey questionnaire.
A variety of university research centers in prominent public and private US universities  were then contacted. Twenty-nine centers were originally contacted, 21 agreed to participate  for an approval rate of 72%. Those opting not to participate did so largely due to time and  resource constraints. The 21 participating university research centers provided complete  lists of their corporate partners, including the names, addresses, and phone numbers of all  ffrm members working with the research center. A survey questionnaire was mailed to each  industrial ffrm representative identiffed. The survey questionnaire data were then used for  hypotheses testing.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The 21 participating research centers consisted of eight NSF supported ERCs, eight NSF  supported IUCRCs, and ffve research centers outside these models. The 21 centers repre�sented a diverse, cross-section of disciplines with a wide variation of member companies  which could extend our ffndings beyond the idiosyncratic nature of one particular center or  limited industry environments. On average, each university research center works with 20  industrial ffrms. In total, the 21 participating centers collaborate with 421 industrial ffrms.
Survey questionnaires were sent to all 421 ffrms. 207 survey questionnaires were returned,  but ffve were missing signiffcant amounts of data. Thus, 202 responses were useable for  a response rate of 48%. No signiffcant differences were found between those responding  to the survey compared to those not responding based on ffrm size, industry, partnering  university research center, or length of relationship.

Culture is important since it inffuences the actions of organizational members by  imposing a repertoire of skills, habits, and values (Denison, 1990; Gordon and DiTomaso,  1992) and can propel the thrust of an organization’s actions by governing the amount  of risk that an organization is willing to expose itself to (Kanter, 1983).

(2) To what  extent does this internal context facilitate these activities?
";;;;;;;number of hierarchical levels, extent to which knowledge and control are concentrated at  the top of the organization (centralization), and degree of adherence to rules and policies  (formalization). The conffguration of these dimensions determines whether a structure is  mechanistic or organic (Burns and Stalker, 1961).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"We extend the ambidextrous model (Duncan, 1976) to explain the relationship between  structure and knowledge transfer activities. According to the ambidextrous model (Dun�can, 1976) innovation is a two-staged process consisting of initiation and implementation  where each stage requires distinct structural forms. Analogous to that idea we propose  that knowledge creation and knowledge integration require a different structural form than  does knowledge acquisition. Organic structures facilitate the initiation of innovation and  the creation of new ideas and knowledge. Organic structures also endow organizations with  porous boundaries enabling them to more effectively scan the external environment and  identify suitable sources of external knowledge. Moreover, organic structures also facilitate  the integration of external knowledge into various internal organizational processes since  the transition of knowledge into a new context requires organizational ffexibility. In con�trast, mechanistic structures facilitate the continual and on-going acquisition of external  knowledge by institutionalizing knowledge transfer activities through a formal structure  and routinized practices and processes (Mintzberg, 1979; Selznick, 1957). The ambidex�trous model, therefore, requires that organizations either switch ffuidly between organic  and mechanistic structures or superimpose one structure upon another in order to create and  acquire knowledge effectively (Duncan, 1976; Zmud, 1982).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; While the ffrm’s internal  context has been shown to be an important determinant for effective environmental scanning  (Yasai-Ardekani and Nystrom, 1996), we extend this position by arguing that a ffrm’s  internal context, determined by past choices, plays a major role in the knowledge acquisition  process in the present time frame. With respect to a ffrm’s internal context, there are three  key elements: organizational structure, organizational culture, and trust. We contend that  when industrial ffrms have these three elements conffgured appropriately, ffrms will be  more effective in acquiring knowledge from an external source than when these factors are  not conffgured properly. ;;;;"The  most appropriate of these alternatives for a given organization can be linked to the notions  of inclusiveness, complementarity, and relatedness. Inclusiveness pertains to the extent to  which an organization has internally available the array of resources and competencies  for completely developing a knowledge base in-house. Complementarity refers to the ex�tent to which two organizations have distinct but mutually synergistic resources necessary  for advancing new knowledge (Teece, 1987). Relatedness exists when a certain amount  of resource commonality exists among two or more organizations (Rumelt, 1974) where  outsourcing to organizations with related resources can be used to obtain supplementary  knowledge (Huber, 1993).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Trust is the “willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of another party based  on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the trustor,  irrespective of the ability to monitor or control the other party” (Mayer et al., 1995:712). In  other words, two parties collaborate to pursue mutually compatible interests rather than to  act opportunistically (Das and Teng, 1998) where opportunism, self-interest seeking with  guile (Williamson, 1975), can be seen as the opposite of cooperation in a collaborative  venture. Two key issues are particularly salient within the context of this study: (1) How  does trust facilitate the institutionalization of knowledge transfer activities? (2) Why is trust  superior to monitoring as a control mechanism in this process?
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"3.3.6. Organization size  This control variable was measured by the number of employees within the ffrm as per  Corsten (1987) and the SBA classiffcation. Coded as a categorical variable, “0” represented  small ffrms; less than 500 employees, “1” represented large ffrms; those with 500 employees  and more.
3.3.7. Geographic proximity  Following Saxenian (1994), this control variable measured the extent to which the ffrm’s  geographic proximity to the university center affected knowledge transfer activities.
";"3.3.4. Flexible and change-oriented culture  Measured by a four-item scale (α = 0.78) representing the strength of the ffrm’s involve�ment and adaptability. Following Denison and Mishra (1995), a ffexible and change-oriented  culture was measured by tapping into the extent of member participation in decisions, the  extent of member cooperation and collaboration across functional roles, the ffrm’s willing�ness and capacity for internal change in response to external environmental conditions, and  the extent to which customers’ comments and recommendations drive changes in the ffrm.
3.3.5. Trust  This variable was measured using a three-item scale (α = 0.70). Following Mayer  et al. (1995), trust was measured by the extent to which industrial ffrm participants were  willing to share ideas, feelings, and speciffc goals with the university center, had conffdence  in the center’s competence as well as its motives and fairness in sharing these abilities,  and perceived that the university center adheres to a set of principles that the ffrm ffnds  acceptable.";"Institutionalization of knowledge transfer activities  The dependent variable was measured by an eight-item scale (α = 0.91) which captured  the extent to which a ffrm had institutionalized the acquisition of knowledge. Following the  NSF’s typology of industry–university collaborative activities (NSF, 1982a) and our own  exploratory interviews conducted at the outset of this research, knowledge transfer embodies  a variety of distinct, yet highly-related activities. Since our focus was on knowledge transfer  activities, we needed to extract those activities from a wider range of collaborative activities  that occur within the I/U context.
";;"3.3.2. Organization structure  This variable was measured by a three-item scale (α = 0.75). Following Burns and  Stalker (1961), organization structure was represented by number of hierarchical levels  within the ffrm, the extent to which members follow directives (extent of centralization),  and the extent to which the ffrm has rigid rules and policies (extent of formalization). Firms  that scored high on hierarchical levels, extent of centralization, and extent of formalization  were classiffed as mechanistic, those scoring low on these three dimensions were classiffed  as organic.
3.3.3. Stable and direction-oriented culture  Measured by a four-item scale (α = 0.84) representing the strength of the ffrm’s  consistency and sense of mission. Following Denison and Mishra (1995), a stable and  direction-oriented culture was measured by tapping into the ffrm’s consistency and pre�dictability in their approach to doing business, the extent of member agreement regarding  the way in which things are done, the extent to which the ffrm has a long-term purpose and  clear direction for the future, and the extent to which ffrm members have a shared vision  regarding what the organization will be like in the future.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"All measures were seven-point  likert-type scales, except for organization size, and were multiple item scales, except for  organization size and geographic proximity. The reliability for each multi-item measure, i.e.
the alpha coefffcients, along with the references to the literature from which these measures  were adapted are included below. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The results from these  analyses provide support for three of this study’s four hypotheses. Speciffcally, consistent  with Hypothesis 1 more mechanistic industrial ffrm structures are associated with greater  institutionalization of knowledge transfer activities (P < 0.01). The results also indicate  that ffrms with more stable and direction-oriented cultures and those more trusting of the  university research center are more likely to institutionalize their knowledge transfer activ�ities. These ffndings provide support for both Hypothesis 2a (P < 0.001) and Hypothesis  3 (P < 0.01). However, contrary to our prediction, we did not ffnd support for Hypoth�esis 2b. In addition to this result being insigniffcant, the regression coefffcient is not in  the predicted direction. In light of these ffndings and contrary to our argument, ffexible and  change-oriented cultures do not appear to be a major negative force in the institutionalization  of knowledge transfer activities.
";"6. Limitations and suggestions for future research  While this study deepens and broadens our understanding of knowledge transfer activities  between industrial ffrms and university research centers, our investigation has limitations. A  key limitation relates to our primary focus on the industrial ffrm. We recognize that collabo�rative ventures mean that there are two or more partners and therefore our concentration on  only the ffrm’s perspective limits the scope of this model. In order to provide a more com�plete picture of the I/U collaborative dynamic, the focus should also encompass areas of joint  concern and involvement. For example, areas such as: (a) the effect of university research  center and industrial ffrm cultural compatibility; (b) effective versus ineffective leadership in  the ffrm and university center; (c) personality confficts between university center personnel  and industrial ffrm participants; and (d) the existence/degree of shared goals.
In collecting data, we obtained participation from a large number of ffrms in a wide  cross-section of industries. Moreover, our respondents were senior-level members of their  ffrms, e.g. VPs/Directors of R&D, Directors of Technology or Project Managers. These  respondents were thoroughly knowledgeable about the I/U relationship, actively involved  in the relationship, and had a signiffcant stake in the collaborative venture. However, virtually  all the data collected in this study were from single-source respondents who single-handedly  described complex organizational characteristics such as structure and culture. Collecting  data from multiple respondents in each of the ffrms would have added richness in capturing  data about these complex constructs. Additionally, since the data for both the dependent and  independent variables were collected from the same person at the same time, the possibility  of mono-method bias exists. As discussed earlier, the average inter-item correlation among  all the variables in this study disclosed a mean of 0.18 indicating a slight positive skew  (Rosenthal and Rosnow, 1991). While this indicates a slight positive response bias, the  strength of the relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable  as shown in the correlation matrix and regression model 2 suggests that strong associations  among these variables indeed exists. However, in light of the possible positive response  bias, a certain level of caution is needed in interpreting these results.
Third, this cross-sectional study should be viewed as providing a description of this  phenomenon rather than demonstrating causality. Future research capturing the temporal
M.D. Santoro, S. Gopalakrishnan / J. Eng. Technol. Manage. 17 (2000) 299–319 315  aspect of industry–university relationships could provide additional insights related to cause  and effect dynamics. Fourth, the reliance on cultural traits has become quite widespread  among cultural researchers (e.g. Hofstede et al., 1990; Gordon and DiTomaso, 1992). We too  chose to pursue a similar research strategy. However, our reliance on the four cultural traits  of involvement, consistency, adaptability, and sense of mission as the basis for representing  stable and direction-oriented and ffexible and change-oriented cultures may be too narrow  and simplistic. A broader model of culture than was employed here may be required in  future research.
Finally, this study focused on knowledge transfer activities in the context of advancing  new technologies. This too is a fairly broad construct within a very extensive and complex  area. Future studies may need to concentrate on more ffne-grained knowledge transfer activ�ities, including: radical versus incremental knowledge, technological versus administrative  knowledge, or product versus process knowledge. These additional research avenues could  extend our ffndings and further advance knowledge on a complex and dynamic phenomenon.

";;This study attempts to address this gap in the literature. To answer these questions, I   propose a theoretical framework that models partnership formation in relation to the sources of   value creation in research alliances. I argue that insofar as university-firm research alliances are   formed intentionally to capitalize on partners’ knowledge, the innovative output depends on the   synergy between the individual capabilities brought to the relationship by both scientists and   firms. ;;;;;;;;;;;This methodology is valid only under strict conditions: either (1) all potentially   relevant characteristics that influence performance are included in the equation and measured   without errors, or (2) the alliance formation is a random process. Clearly, the first condition is   hardly met in empirical studies. In strategy research, where great emphasis is placed on the   strategic i.e. non-random aspect of alliance partner selection, the second condition is equally   problematic.;;;;;;;This potential endogeneity problem has been mentioned in the empirical literature (Cockburn   and Henderson 1998, Zucker et al. 2002). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;While these studies establish that in-house basic research is necessary for utilizing academic   knowledge and engaging in direct ties with scientists, the question that I raise is whether firm�scientist alliances are driven by the synergy between scientists and firms with higher scientific   capabilities. In other words, within the population of firms that collaborate with the academia, do   better scientists work with firms with higher scientific capabilities? Or, do prominent scientists   substitute for the lack of outstanding scientific capabilities? The later, substitution hypothesis, is   consistent with the view that given the high transaction costs inherent to any research alliance,   firms will not engage in external collaborations unless external sources are substantially better   than what firms could do internally (Hoetker, 2005). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Estimation Method. The main challenge in estimating complementarities arises directly   from the fact that the observed alliances are formed through a matching process, wherein each   partner choice decision depends on all other relationships formed in the market. This aspect   complicates the estimation, because there are as many endogenous variables as the observed   matches. When alliances are treated as independent decisions, as it is done in standard discrete   choice models, the likelihood of observing a set of firm-scientist pairs can be factored into a   product of low-dimensional integrals representing the likelihoods of each agent’s decision to ally. 
Conversely, in a matching situation, all error terms must be integrated simultaneously. The   standard ML estimation approach requires integrating over thousand dimensions- a procedure   that is not possible numerically.";;;;;;Firm-level variables.

The matching perspective points   out that in contexts in which synergistic gains are crucial, competition for partners takes place on   attributes relevant to innovation. By identifying the various characteristics that drive the   matching of firms and scientists in research alliances, the model explains why certain firm�scientists collaborations are more likely to attain superior performance. It also generates useful   insights for firms that seek to attract better partners, particularly “star” faculty.

The paper contributes to the management literature by introducing a model of alliance   formation that explicitly addresses the endogeneity problem created by the self-selection of the   partners into alliances. The framework developed here has a broad applicability to other business   situations in which the researcher anticipates endogenous sorting and strategic intent in partner   selection.

Survey participants were asked to complete a  detailed questionnaire on their departments’ knowledge transfer activities and university�industry collaborations during the period 2004–2007. The questionnaires were addressed to  the directors of 1,047 EPS departments5  ; the response rate was 18.8 % (197 completed  questionnaires).6 ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Cognitive distance ​ University-industry collaboration ​ Knowledge transfer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Among the many problems is the signiffcant tension  between the ideal norms of ‘open science’ and the Mertonian ethos (Merton 1973), which  for so long contributed to orienting the structure and conduct of research in academia, and  the business-type imperatives that are at the basis of strategies aimed at the commercial�ization of research based on strong intellectual property rights (IPR) protection, licensing  activities and creation of spinoff ffrms. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Based on original data  from interviews with 197 university departments in Italy, our analysis determines whether  cognitive distance is perceived as a barrier to university-industry interactions, and esti�mates its effects on the frequency of their collaborations.;;;;;;;In this paper, we focus on the concept of cognitive distance, intended as differences in the  sets of basic values, norms and mental models in universities and ffrms. We assess the  impact of cognitive distance on university-industry collaborations. ;;;;;;;;;;; sets out the theoretical background and  explains why cultural heterogeneity is worth exploring in an analysis of university-industry  collaboration;;;;;;; However, while ffrms are seeing interaction  with universities as essential for their strategies (Faulkner et al. 1995), the universities are  under political and societal pressure, to adopt an explicit ‘entrepreneurial’ stance (Clark  1998).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Firms can no longer rely on their internal knowledge  resources, but need to ffnd efffcient ways to manage a complex set of knowledge inffows  and outffows within the boundaries of their organization (Chesbrough et al. 2006; Amesse  and Cohendet 2001). Within this framework, universities represent an invaluable source of  qualiffed knowledge, and commercial exploitation of scientiffc output increasingly is seen  as the driver of competitiveness and growth. However, while ffrms are seeing interaction  with universities as essential for their strategies (Faulkner et al. 1995), the universities are  under political and societal pressure, to adopt an explicit ‘entrepreneurial’ stance (Clark  1998). Several countries have introduced progressive cuts in research funding that have  encouraged universities to collaborate with industry and develop initiatives in favour of  knowledge transfer (Muscio 2010). Universities are now more committed than in the past  to embracing their ‘third mission’, and work to become poles of local economic devel�opment, which involves expanding the range of their outreach activities and their rela�tionships with the private sector (Gulbrandsen and Slipersæter 2007).2";;;;;;;;;;"A detailed analysis of the process of university-industry collaboration must take into  consideration the complex interplay among the variables at different levels: the system  level, described in the systems of innovation literature (Edquist 2005); the institutional  level, which explains the differences among universities operating within the same system  (Di Gregorio and Shane 2003); and the individual level (Bercovitz and Feldman 2008). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;University-industry collaborations are characterized by complex patterns of bidi�rectional knowledge exchanges (Meyer-Krahmer and Schmoch 1998), and US surveys  show that faculty members consider the possibility of advancing their own research agenda  as an important incentive for developing collaborations with ffrms (Lee 2000). ;;;;;;;;;We conducted an econometric analysis on the determinants of university-industry col�laboration to examine more deeply the inffuence of cognitive distance on the propensity for  universities to engage in collaborations with the private sector.

Case studies are useful in generating and developing  theory in under-researched areas (Siggelkow, 2007), and a theoretically  informed case approach provides a valuable means with which to  communicate study findings (Buchanan and Dawson, 2007). Expanding  on this point, given the importance of methodological fit for under�taking high quality field research, and within this, the appropriateness  of exploratory qualitative research for studying a nascent phenomenon  (Edmondson and McManus, 2007), which accurately reflects the status  of PI role identity within the literature, a case analysis of HRC PIs  through qualitative research is suitably justified. Central to our research  design is the acceptance of HRC funded PIs as ‘knowledgeable agents’  (Gehman et al., 2018) who can give unparalleled insights on what they  are trying to do and what they are experiencing as they enact the role  identity of PI.
";;;;;;;;This paper examines the role identity of university based principal investigators (PIs), as well as the learning  mechanisms that underpin this position. PIs have become the focus of increasing research attention which has  argued that they, along with universities and funding bodies, form an increasingly crucial tripartite in public  research environments.

Most  research on role identity in science has centred on the general academic  community's attempts to reconcile academic and commercial goals  (Ambos et al., 2008; Jain et al., 2009; Meek and Wood (2016)).
Cohen and Munshi (2017) show how academic entrepreneurs must  completely recombine social, spatial, intellectual and institutional as�pects of their ‘old’ academic selves to launch and fund new ventures. In  comparison, little if any research has focused on elucidating the role  identity of PIs.

Another  worthy area of study involves focusing on PIs where their funded pro�jects failed to attain the desired project outcomes. ;;"How did such project  failures influence or be influenced by PI role identity enactment?

It is shown how UTTOs have  to be present at the beginning, but they are later ignored, so their role as institutional promoters of  entrepreneurs [70] and as agents in the regional networking activities [71] is questioned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Network Bricolage  AEs behave as entrepreneurs-bricoleurs, using their pre-existing networks as resources at  hand [23]. In this network bricolage between formal and informal networks, different factors have  been found as relevant for entrepreneurial opportunities identiffcation and exploitation, both for  formal networks (security, knowledge exchange, development opportunities/new projects and business,  contacts, infrastructure and human resources) and for informal networks (contacts, personal support,  collaboration and building trust, ffnancial resources collaboration, development/new business and  markets, and knowledge exchange). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Finally, we used a ffve-phase cycle for the analysis of the interviews [63]. It consisted of compiling,  disassembling, reassembling, interpreting, and concluding the data collected previously. The results  of the qualitative data are summarized next, using a narrative approach. In the interview analysis,  the process of network bricolage in AE showed several general issues. Quotations from the interviewees,  identiffed with the number of participant (as listed in Table 1), are cited in short in the next section in  order to illustrate the main issues;This paper studies the network bricolage process of academic entrepreneurs (AEs). Based on  a qualitative study, surprisingly, it shows how these entrepreneurs still encounter institutional barriers  which exist in universities, in particular regarding building the social capital needed for exploiting  their business ideas, and they are not, as expected, well connected to the existing formal networks  but rather to the informal ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Speciffcally, the study reveals the existence of a  relevant network bricolage process of these AEs using informal versus formal networks to develop  their ventures. ;;"This research uses the bricolage perspective to entrepreneurship [23], and analyze these main  players, in particular how they self-select formal versus informal networks depending on what  they need or are looking for. Consequently, our Research Question (RQ) is: How do AE overcome  institutional barriers regarding networks?
";;;;;" Universities are the main agents in the  production of new knowledge and the improvement of human capital and now are facing the new  role of providing the necessary leadership to advance in the entrepreneurial society by means of  promoting entrepreneurial thinking, actions, institutions, and entrepreneurial capital [3], with the so  called ‘third stream activities’ [4].
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This model of a university is supported by an ecosystem that produce, diffuse, absorb,  and use new knowledge and these actions can result on entrepreneurial initiatives [11]. For this model,  faculty members willing to be academic entrepreneurs (AEs) are relevant agents [12–14], as they are  considered the engines of academic entrepreneurship in breaking the ivory tower [15]. In addition,  other externalities exist, as these AEs are better teachers and researchers than academics who have not  engaged in entrepreneurial activities [16].
";;;;;"Academic entrepreneurship is one of the ways in which universities’ knowledge is disseminated  and exploited by industry [29,30], resulting in university start-ups [7]. It is an expression of the  engagement of researchers in Knowledge Transfer Exchange (KTE) [6,31] in the context of the  entrepreneurial university [9–11,17,32]. This model of university is characterized by the existence of a  supportive ecosystem to the university community which produces, diffuses, absorbs, and uses new  knowledge, and these actions can result on entrepreneurial initiatives [11].
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;As a consequence, universities have adopted a narrower focus on the transfer of scientists’  inventions from laboratories to industry [5], contributing to the economy and the development of  the society [6,7]. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; This paper uses the bricolage approach of entrepreneurship and the  literature on academic entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial universities, and social capital. In-depth  interviews with key informants were conducted. ;;;;;;We will discuss our main ffndings following this structure: social capital, the need of network  bricolage, network bricolage, and intermediaries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"As contributions, this paper extends the knowledge on the individual level of the development  of entrepreneurial universities in four ways. First, it shows how AEs encounter institutional barriers  in universities, which make building social capital difffcult [19]. Second, it enriches the knowledge  on the process of exploiting business opportunities of AEs in non-favorable institutional settings.
Third, it describes how the networks are developed to access resources for different strategies and  life-cycle phases of the entrepreneurial process [25]. Fourth, it reveals the existence of a relevant network  bricolage process of these AEs using what networks they have at hand (‘see-sawing’ formal versus  informal) to develop their ventures, extending the knowledge on how and why these entrepreneurs  self-select formal versus informal networks depending on what they are looking for [26]. This bricolage  process helps with the institutional barriers, answering the RQ.
";;;"Regarding limitations, whilst this study is based on twenty-ffve interviews, the results are relevant  for the analyzed context, and worldwide as a way of illustrating network bricolage by AEs in an  institutionalized context. However, as Fini, Grimaldi, Santoni, et al. [12] also pointed out, the ffndings  could be caused by the regional settings’ idiosyncrasies that might be seen also as a limitation of  the results of this study. More data from other contexts and countries would help to increase the  value of the analysis. In addition, a quantitative study with more data coming from all the agents  involved in academic entrepreneurship would add more value to the results. However, due to the  nature of the network bricolage, the conducted study based on qualitative data is considered to be  appropriate. Furthermore, this is an exploratory approach to study bricolage at the individual level,  thus AEs have been analyzed in the context of the universities as institutions. However, we have not  considered or controlled the empirical study by the intensity of the institutions that promote academic  entrepreneurship in the region. Finally, the international cooperation of the university, the type of  scientiffc discipline, and the location of scientiffc institutions in existing industrial clusters have not  speciffcally being considered and would have enriched the analysis. All of this might be included in  further research.

Paola Paoloni (2020) - Knowledge resources in the university context an overview of the literature;;;;;;;;;;;;"The database used to extract the information was SCOPUS because it is widely used and  the largest available database for the multidisciplinary scientific literature (de Moya-Aneg​on  et al., 2007). SCOPUS provides both confidence in the quality of the publications and  information about the authors’ affiliations. The research and subsequent extractions were  made on April 8 2019.
As the protocol suggests, to select relevant documents related to the intangible assets of  knowledge and capital in the university context, the authors identified specific keywords to  find research that extends existing topics in a particular field. The keywords used were  “intellectual capital” and “universit*” (to include both the word “university” and  “universities” in the results). The authors limited the search to “Paper title,” “Abstract”  and “Keywords” to prevent documents not related to the objective of the research being  extracted.
This search produced only 470 results. Considering this number of results not significant  for applying the SLR method, the authors selected another keyword that includes the IC  topics: “knowledge management.” Thus, a second enquiry was performed using the  keywords “knowledge management” and “universit*,” which produced 4,355 results. To  establish the boundaries of the research, for the searches described above, authors’ academic  backgrounds were used to select relevant research (Massaro et al., 2016). Thus, research not  related to the accounting categories was eliminated (i.e. computer science, engineering, social  sciences, mathematics, decision sciences, medicine, arts and humanities, psychology, energy,  agricultural and biological sciences, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology, physics  and astronomy, neuroscience, nursing, pharmacology and veterinary).
With these filters applied, the total number of results was reduced from 4,825 (4,355  þ 470) to 1,361, which included different types of documents (articles, books, book chapters,  conference papers and reviews). To further refine the search, the authors considered the  publication stage of the contributions and limited the search results only to “Article,” “Book”  and “Book chapter,” resulting in 913 results. The goal of this limitation was to include only  contributions that had achieved the final stage of publication.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Universities, Intellectual capital, Knowledge management, Structured literature review,  Entrepreneurial universities;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"research focusing on the activities that universities carry out to improve their  competitive advantage.

(5) Other: this is a residual category that includes results of the SLR that do not belong to  any of the previous categories. This class includes research not related to the aim of  the present paper but that arose in the findings only because the keyword  “university” was present in the abstract section only (because this entity was the  publisher of the research [e.g. “....

Limitations and value of the work  One limitation of this research is that a manual approach was used because it is more cost  effective and flexible. Furthermore, the classification entailed the use of a personal judgment,  which could affect the results. To reduce the risk of the bias, the authors worked together to  identify the main classes and to classify abstracts.

Research carried out by Siegel et al. (2003) showed that hiring graduate students and  fellows was an extremely efffcient way of transferring technology, even if its beneffts are  not apparent in the short term. A study by Salimi et al.

A total of 251 questionnaires were received and 244 questionnaires were validated  (response rate of 42.9%). The scientiffc areas of the doctoral programmes in the sample  are statistically well represented: programmes in Social Sciences and Arts and Humanities  are the most frequent, while programmes in Exact Sciences and Agricultural and Veterin�ary Sciences represent a smaller percentage, both in reality and in the sample. Moreover,  the most represented universities in the sample are also the most represented universities  in Portugal.
The analysis was conducted using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23 software. Data analysis  combined descriptive analysis with multivariate analysis. Through a Principal Component  Analysis (PCA), it was possible to reduce the information and characterise the existing col�laborations. Linear and logistic regression analyses were also performed, which allowed  data to support the causal argumentation in greater depth (Hair et al., 2006).";;;;;;The scientiffc area is a variable that allows us to portray important aspects of collabor�ation in doctoral programmes. The ‘company involvement in doctoral research’ is a col�laborative component that exists primarily in the area of Engineering Sciences and  Technology (EST) and is very low in the Social Sciences (SS) and Arts and Humanities  (AH).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"the scientiffc area has an impact on  whether or not collaboration takes place: programmes in Engineering Sciences and Tech�nology are more likely to involve collaboration, explaining 20.4% of total variance and  increasing the likelihood of collaboration by 3.14 times (B = 3.141, p < .001). Programmes  in the Social Sciences have the opposite effect on collaboration, reducing its likelihood by  0.99 times (B = −0.976, p < .05).

• How are teaching and research funding criteria being shaped by policy interventions?
• Which stakeholders are involved—are they particular lead stakeholders, collective  representatives or interested parties?
• How have universities responded in terms of redeffning their institutional approach to  social engagement?
";;;;;;;;;" Valorisation is therefore broader than  ‘commercialisation’, motivated by commercial profft in the context of an increasingly  marketised academy (Slaughter and Leslie 1997, 2001; Bridgman and Wilmott 2007).
However, there is also an active tension between valorisation and commercialisation, with  valorisation often framed as commercialisation, potentially narrowly understood in terms  of universities’ economic contributions, potentially overshadowing broader societal con�tributions (OECD 2007).

Stakeholders are not solely passive  recipients of general beneffts; they may demand a more active voice in the organisation’s  running to improve the value of their share and their beneffts. Universities’ ‘stakeholders’  include those potentially positioned to benefft from universities’ social impacts (Freeman  1984). As universities’ wider social aims have evolved, new classes of university stake�holder have emerged. Allen (1988) argues that universities have long—if implicitly—  pioneered the use of stakeholder management—both internally and externally—as a way  of handling their ambiguous purposes, to suppress open conffict between different con�stituencies (Cohen and March 1974; Baumunt 1997).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;We have chosen three policies that differ widely in  terms of their programme size, their mechanism, and their applicability. In each case, we  ffrstly consider the background framing of HASS valorisation within national policy dis�courses. We then consider how these types of instruments have affected the legitimacy,  urgency and power of HASS users, and also within that, which types of HASS stakeholders  have beneffted. From that, we develop a bigger picture of how different valorisation  instruments produce different institutional responses, and ultimately increase the voice of  HASS users in the science governance system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Whilst there might be a lot of rhetoric around valorisation through engagement with  community stakeholders, there is no evidence to suggest that community engagement has  taken the step analogous to that taken by commercialisation. As Jongbloed et al. note ‘‘the  growing chorus over the role of universities as economic engines has elevated the debate  beyond rhetoric and into the realm of policy action’’ (2008, p. 313);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Paul E. Bierly III (2009) - The Application of External Knowledge Organizational Conditions for Exploration and Exploitation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"We collected data from both primary and documentary sources. We collected primary  data following Dillman’s (1978) ‘total design method’, whereby we ffrst conducted a  comprehensive literature review followed by ten in-depth, semi-structured interviews  with senior executives in a random sample of ffrms in the targeted industries to clarify our  conceptual framework and obtain face validity for our survey questionnaire. Next, we  prepared a survey questionnaire and pretested it with 20 part-time MBA students who  held full-time corporate positions with at least seven years of business experience. We  conducted a debrieffng after pretesting to obtain additional feedback from this group,  and, based on pretesting and debrieffng, we modiffed some of the questionnaire items to  properly tap into this study’s speciffc context.
We mailed the revised questionnaire to 1250 ffrms. The cover letter made clear that  suitable ffrms for this research had to be currently or previously involved within the last  three years in a URC relationship such as an NSF-supported university engineering  research centre, an NSF-supported industry–university cooperative research centre, or a  general research centre supported by the university and private funding. After the ffrst  mailing, we received 138 responses. Prior to our second mailing we placed phone calls to  non-respondents and discovered that a large percentage of the ffrms (65 per cent) did not  respond because they had not had a URC relationship within the last three years. After a  second mailing we received 42 additional responses for a total of 180 completed question�naires. Of the 1250 ffrms in the sample, 438 ffrms fft our selection criteria of being currently  or previously involved in a URC relationship within the past three years.[5] The response  rate for eligible ffrms was 41.1 per cent (180 responses from 438 ffrms), and the overall  response rate was 14.4 per cent (of the 1250 questionnaires distributed). Both rates are  acceptable for a mail survey using this type of research design (Dillman, 1978).

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Financial leverage. Financial resources can be a source of competitive advantage even  though they are not themselves unique or difffcult to imitate (Peteraf, 1993). Firms that  are profftable are more likely to have slack resources (Rosner, 1968), enabling them to  leverage their proffts and make value-creating investments for future profftability when  some of these value-creating investments can be directed towards supporting EKA  initiatives. ;;;"Experience. Prior collaborative experiences support EKA when ffrms rely on information  and knowledge in areas where they have had success (Lane et al., 2001; Zahra and  George, 2002). Past experiences also shape organizational memory so that future  attempts trigger positive responses, thus reducing resistance to change and increasing  commitment (Walsh and Ungson, 1991). Through their prior collaborative experiences,  ffrms institutionalize learning mechanisms, legitimate the EKA process, and establish  organizational routines that enable future learning to be more efffcient and effective  (Nelson and Winter, 1982; Zollo and Winter, 2002).
";;;;;;;Technological capability and relatedness. According to research on organizational learning,  ‘What can be learned is directly related to what is already known’ (Inkpen and Pien,  2006, p. 781). Hence, the ability to internalize and apply external knowledge is often  enhanced by a ffrm’s internal capabilities, such as in-house R&D, production experience,  and technical training. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"We conceive the transfer of knowledge from external sources to be a two-step process  (Zahra and George, 2002). First, knowledge is transferred from an external source to the  organization. Second, the transferred knowledge is applied to the development or reffne�ment of products and processes. We call the ffrst step ‘external knowledge transfer’  (EKT) and the second step ‘external knowledge application’ (EKA). We argue that the  process of EKA is distinct from the processes associated with transferring external  knowledge into the organization, and therefore we control for EKT and investigate  conditions that facilitate EKA. In doing so, in this study we examine two aspects of  applying external knowledge: (a) the situation when ffrms apply external knowledge for  generating new technologies and products; and (b) when they apply external knowledge  for enhancing existing products and processes.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Absorptive capacity is an important capability for ffrms following an innovation strategy.
Firms add new knowledge by building on their previous knowledge base. Since adding  new knowledge requires learning from external sources, especially when the new knowl�edge is beyond a ffrm’s existing capabilities, the innovative outcome for an organization  in a technologically progressive environment is a function of its absorptive capacity  (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The empirical setting extends the two existing studies that departed from the predomi�nant one-dimensional view of absorptive capacity, where the transfer and application of  external knowledge were viewed mostly as a single process. ;;;;;;Control variables. We controlled for three factors that were shown to be consequential in  industry–university collaborative ventures (Santoro and Chakrabarti, 2002). Industrial  Sector was identiffed using the ffrm’s four-digit SIC code obtained through a combina�tion of Dun & Bradstreet’s Business Report and InfoUSA. Initial analyses showed that none  of the 11 different industrial sectors alone were signiffcantly associated with knowledge  transfer.;"We  deffne the second step, EKA, as the use of the transferred knowledge within the ffrm to  create new or to improve existing products and processes.[1] Our focus in this study is  speciffcally on the processes associated with EKA.
";;;"Strategic posture. An organization’s strategic posture inffuences its capacity for learning by  providing a context for the interpretation of the environment and setting limits on the  decision-making process (Fiol and Lyles, 1985; Nieto and Quevedo, 2005). Covin and  Slevin (1989) deffned strategic posture broadly as a ffrm’s overall entrepreneurial orien�tation, arguing that strategic posture is a basic, one-dimensional construct comprised of  three components – innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk taking – where these com�ponents reffect the ffrm’s entrepreneurial versus conservative orientation (Miller, 1983).
We propose that an entrepreneurial strategic posture will positively affect an organiza�tion’s ability to apply the external knowledge because it institutionalizes the constant  pursuit of innovation and learning, minimizes resistance to change by promoting open�ness in communication and knowledge sharing (Smith and Tushman, 2005; Tushman  and Smith, 2002), and minimizes the not-invented-here syndrome by encouraging  acceptance of new knowledge regardless of its source (Leonard-Barton, 1995).";Financial Leverage was measured by average return on sales (net income/total  revenue) for the years 2000–02. We collected data from Research Insight. Because there  was a wide variation in this measure among the ffrms in the sample, we used the natural  logarithm.;;;"Moderator variable. Knowledge Tacitness (a = 0.84) was measured by a two-item  scale (Simonin, 1999). Because scores closer to 1 indicate knowledge was more tacit  and scores closer to 7 indicate knowledge was more explicit, this variable was  reverse-coded.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Dependent variables. For EKA–exploration we measured the application of knowledge  from URCs for the development of new products and processes and the activities that  lead to them (e.g. patents); for EKA–exploitation we measured the application of knowl�edge from URCs for the modiffcation and improvement of products and processes  (Santoro, 2000).

• Accessed outside facilities from the URC to strengthen its core area of business.
• Obtained knowledge from the URC for extending its core business resources.

";;;;;;"The scales for both variables were reliable (EKA–exploration, a = 0.86;  EKA–exploitation, a = 0.87). We also conducted conffrmatory factor analysis on EKA–  exploration versus EKA–exploitation to ensure construct validity. Results showed that  each item loaded signiffcantly onto our proposed factor (p < 0.001) and that the overall  fft of our proposed two-factor solution was good (c2  /df = 2.02, RMSEA = 0.071,  CFI = 0.923, IFI = 0.934, NFI = 0.926, and GFI = 0.919), indicating the two variables  are empirically distinguishable.
";"We checked for non-response bias and found no signiffcant differences between ffrms  responding and ffrms not responding based on ffrm size (t = 0.61, p > 0.50), industrial  sector (t = 0.40, p > 0.60), or ffrm location (t = 1.1, p > 0.20).[6] There were also no  signiffcant differences between ffrms responding in the ffrst and the second mailing based  on ffrm size (t = 0.93, p > 0.25), industrial sector (t = 0.20, p > 0.70) or ffrm location  (t = 0.85, p > 0.30).
";"Firms’ Experience with URCs was measured by a three-item scale (a = 0.91) similar  to the Industrial Research Institute’s (1995) measure.[8] We operationalized Technologi�cal Capability by the ffrm’s R&D intensity (R&D investment/sales revenue), a measure  of absolute absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Tsai, 2001). We obtained  data from Research Insight and averaged for the years 2000–02. Technological Relat�edness was operationalized by a four-item scale (a = 0.75) reffecting the importance of  technological and facility overlap with the URC to supplement and strengthen the ffrm’s  technological base (Santoro and Chakrabarti, 2002).
";;;;;;;;" Strategic Posture was measured by a seven-item scale (a = 0.89).[7]  Based on a conffrmatory factor analysis, the seven items loaded signiffcantly onto one  factor (p < 0.001), and there was a good fft for our proposed solution (c2  /df = 1.1,  RMSEA = 0.063, CFI = 0.945, IFI = 0.927, NFI = 0.931, and GFI = 0.922).
";;;;;Results show that predictors of exploration and exploitation of the application of  external knowledge differ. Surprisingly, technological relatedness, a common measure of  absorptive capacity, is negatively associated with the application of external knowledge to  explorative innovations, indicating that knowledge from more distant sources is applied more  to exploration. Results also indicate that the effects of two external learning capabilities (prior  experience with URCs and technological capability) on knowledge application are moderated  in such a way by the tacitness of the knowledge transferred that experience is a stronger  predictor when the knowledge is more explicit and technological capability is a stronger  predictor when the knowledge is more tacit. ;;Second, a central thesis of this study that received empirical support was that a  distinction between exploration and exploitation in the application of external knowl�edge matters. However, we examined the effects of only three external learning capa�bilities and two important strategic capabilities. ;;"Implications for Future Research  Several promising opportunities exist to further extend research in this area. First, Cohen  and Levinthal (1990) emphasized the role of related prior knowledge in determining  absorptive capacity. We recognized three components of related prior knowledge and  found that knowledge tacitness moderates their relationship with EKA. Firms transfer  both tacit and explicit external knowledge and apply them to develop both exploratory  and exploitative innovations. Therefore, our ffnding can be expanded in future research  to provide a better understanding of a broader framework of organizational factors and  processes for the application of external knowledge by examining conditions that would  facilitate each of the four possible combinations of tacitness and EKA types: EKA–  exploration of tacit knowledge, EKA–exploration of explicit knowledge, EKA–  exploitation of tacit knowledge, and EKA–exploitation of explicit knowledge.

Second, a central thesis of this study that received empirical support was that a  distinction between exploration and exploitation in the application of external knowl�edge matters. However, we examined the effects of only three external learning capa�bilities and two important strategic capabilities. To understand why and how  organizations may choose to emphasize applying transferred knowledge for exploration  or exploitation, or a combination of both, future research can extend the sets of the  determinants of EKA and examine environmental conditions (e.g. change, dynamism,  predictability, competitiveness, etc) that motivate the decision. Research could also be  further extended by determining which organizational processes enable ffrms to excel at  exploration and exploitation simultaneously, allowing them to become truly ambidex�trous organizations.
Third, we found a better fft for EKA–exploration than EKA–exploitation. This may  suggest that when it comes to transferring and applying knowledge obtained from URCs,  ffrms may be driven more by the pursuit of exploration-type applications than  exploitation-type applications. This notion is consistent with previous research that  shows collaborative ventures with URCs can provide ffrms with unique knowledge that  is not easily obtained from other external sources and that is fundamental for creating  and shaping the building blocks necessary for advancing new technologies and products  (Santoro and Betts, 2002). As ffrms engage in different types of collaborative relationships  beyond those with URCs, and the type of relationship inffuences the process of knowl�edge transfer and application, the results of this study should be conffrmed by studies of  other types and forms of collaborative ventures.
Finally, we based our empirical analysis on a single cross-section of data. Although this  method is appropriate for testing our hypotheses, a longitudinal analysis examining the  transfer and application of external knowledge from universities will provide additional  insights concerning different timing issues for exploratory and exploitative innovations.
The transfer and application of knowledge from an external source is a process; however,  although we control for EKT in our analysis, we do not have longitudinal data to  examine the entire process. Future research can address this limitation by analysing  longitudinal data and testing alternative explanations stemming from a ffrm’s history of  knowledge transfer and application from URCs.

Paula C. Isiordia-Lachica (2020) - Identification and Analysis of Technology and Knowledge Transfer Experiences for the Agro-Food Sector in Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The ffrst idea was a statistical analysis of data with systematized information on TKT, based on  the identiffcation of scientiffc articles in Scopus and Web of Science databases, but it was scrapped  because we did not ffnd papers related with the Mexican agro-food sector. Then, we decided to carry  out a mostly qualitative approach study based on searching documented cases on offfcial websites.
This study used a mixed research methodology. In a ffrst phase, a qualitative approach was used,  and in the second, a quantitative one.

On the other hand, we have the objective of identifying different types of elements  involved in the processes of technology and knowledge transfer (TKT), as well as the beneffts and  results that have generated those involved. In particular, we need to know if the communication and  information technology is used, and if there is the creation, storage and exchange of knowledge [19].
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Open innovation has been deffned as ""the use of intentional inputs and outputs of knowledge to  accelerate internal innovation and expand markets for external use of innovation, respectively"" [32].
Open innovation is now more focused on using external sources of innovation, such as clients, rivals,  and universities [33]. In this process, the knowledge transfer, contributions such as time, work and other  resources obtained through inter-organizational collaboration play an important role for innovation.
On one hand, collaboration could be perceived as knowledge that ffows through the organization  limits; on the other hand, different ways to organize open innovation practices could bring companies  closer to each other in terms of possible partnerships in new initiatives ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;As pointed out recently by the OECD [7],  the ability of a nation to generate and benefft from an innovation policy depends primarily on  planning and pursuing a quite complex system, commonly referred to as the triple helix model  (THM). This is an innovation system based on a direct relationship between three main actors:  higher education institutions (HEIs) and public research institutes, government and business sector,  as depicted in Figure 1. Since its emergence, the THM had been the basis of several theoretical  and empirical studies to understand and assess the dynamic phenomenon of multiple reciprocal  academia–industry–government relations, responsible for the creation of knowledge, technology  transfer and knowledge capitalization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The THM assumes that academy bodies, the government and the private and  industrial sectors may play a signiffcant role in the establishment of innovation policies, with strong  economic growth and social transformation effects. However, the implementation of the THM requires  dramatic HEIs transformation, from just being a teaching institution to becoming a teaching and  research institution, along with novel legislative and speciffc bylaws to regulate the relationship of  university, industry, or private sector and government.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"information was obtained, the source of the publication (news agency, government agency, entity, etc.),  a brief description of the case and/or the transfer mechanism, the higher education institutions (HEI)  or research centers (RCs) involved in the case, as well as the results, beneffts and important elements to  carry out the transfer.
From that summary, in the second phase, a quantitative analysis was made, by counting frequencies  that allowed grouping different types of elements and results/beneffts, which allowed for a basic  descriptive statistic.
";;;;;;For the purposes of this investigation, TKT is both the technology movement and the know-how  ffow between partners (individuals, entities and companies), with the objective of improving at least  one knowledge and ability of the partners, as well as strengthening the competitive position of each of  the associates [22]. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"According to different approaches that consider the TKT to be successful, we ffnd that in Mexico  there are experiences of different levels. There are cases at the most basic level where success is deffned  as the number of knowledge transfers that take place over a certain period [46]. We identiffed such  cases because there is a critical mass of them, despite the little documentation and dissemination that  the issue still has in Mexico.

Perkmann 2013 - Academic engagement and commercialisation;;;;;;;;;;;;We performed a systematic review of the available evidence  on academic engagement. Such a literature review establishes the  state of current knowledge in a ffeld (Tranffeld et al., 2003). In med�ical ffelds, such reviews synthesise empirical evidence from large  numbers of studies and identify areas of consensus and disagree�ment between researchers within certain areas of research. This  principle can be fruitfully adopted in the social sciences although  the overall number of existing studies tends to be smaller, meas�ures and variables are less tightly deffned and conclusions may be  more contestable. For the current article, we followed a simpliffed  version of the process outlined by Tranffeld et al. (2003) which we  detail below.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Extent of academic engagement  Academic engagement is varied and includes collaborative  research, contract research, consulting and other forms of;;;;;;University–industry relations  Technology transfer  Academic entrepreneurship  Commercialisation  Collaborative research  Academic consulting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Organisational context  The most salient organisational-level determinant for academic  engagement is represented by the quality of academics’ university  or department. The overall effect of organisation-level academic  quality on participation in collaboration activities appears to be  negative (D’Este and Patel, 2007; Ponomariov, 2008; Ponomariov  and Boardman, 2008). T";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;We address these gaps by presenting a systematic review of the  literature on academic engagement. ;;;;;;;Academic engagement and commercialisation: A review of the literature on  university–industry relations;;;;;;;;;We present a systematic  review of research on academic scientists’ involvement in these activities to which we refer as ‘aca�demic engagement’. Apart from extracting ffndings that are generalisable across studies, we ask how  academic engagement differs from commercialisation, deffned as intellectual property creation and aca�demic entrepreneurship. ;;;;;;;;;;; The research question guiding  our review is: What are the antecedents and consequences of aca�demic engagement? We will consolidate results from all existing  studies and extract generally applicable result;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Here we clarify the concept of academic engagement, and  its relationship to the concept of commercialisation. Academic  engagement is characterised by the following aspects which  refer to organisation and objectives, respectively. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" To support  commercialisation, many universities have established specialised  structures, such as technology transfer offfces (TTOs), science parks  and incubators (Clarysse et al., 2005; Siegel et al., 2003), and created  supportive internal rules and procedures (Thursby et al., 2001).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Third, we make a methodological contribution, by discussing  why studying academic engagement requires methodological  approaches that differ from those for studying commercialisation.
We also identify the challenges posed by these approaches and  suggest how they may be overcome";;;;;;"At this stage, we read and synthesised each remaining arti�cle, compiling the following information in tabular form (Pawson,  2006): research questions, data used, methodology, variables, and  ffndings (Appendix B). We synthesised this information into a pre�liminary report and held a full-day workshop, with all the authors  present, to debate the ffndings and implications of our discoveries  and used the results from the workshop to revise the report.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" Individual characteristics  Individual characteristics play an important role in predict�ing academic engagement. Male academics are signiffcantly more  likely to engage with industry (Azagra-Caro, 2007; Boardman,  2008; Giuliani et al., 2010; Goktepe-Hulten, 2010; Link et al.,  2007). Age has an ambiguous effect, even when controlling for  seniority. Some studies ffnd a positive relationship (Boardman  and Ponomariov, 2009; Haeussler and Colyvas, 2011; Link et al.,  2007), while others ffnd a negative relationship (Bekkers and Bodas  Freitas, 2008; D’Este and Patel, 2007; D’Este and Perkmann, 2011;  Giuliani et al., 2010) or no relationship at all (Boardman and  Ponomariov, 2009; Gulbrandsen and Smeby, 2005; Renault, 2006).
The negative impact of age found by some studies may reffect a  training effect: individuals who were trained in earlier periods  when universities’ engagement with industry was less relevant  or even discouraged, may be attached to norms not compatible  with collaboration with private companies (Bercovitz and Feldman,  2008).
";"Institutional context  We consider two aspects of the institutional context in which  academics operate: the afffliation to a scientiffc discipline and the  effect of speciffc national regulations and public policies. Both fac�tors inform academic engagement as they shape the norms and  rules relevant for researchers, either because they are offfcial gov�ernment regulations or because they are the rules of conduct  prevailing within the ‘invisible colleges’ in which academics oper�ate (Crane, 1972).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"As a ffnal step in our analysis, we systematically compared  the results obtained on academic engagement with what is  known about academics’ involvement in commercialisation, i.e.
academic entrepreneurship and IP-related activities. Unlike aca�demic engagement, research on commercialisation has previously  been systematically documented and synthesised by published  reviews (Geuna and Muscio, 2009; Larsen, 2011; Phan et al., 2005;  Rothaermel et al., 2007) and we therefore use that literature for our  comparison.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"5.1. Implications for the concept of academic engagement  The systematic literature review and comparison with extant  research on commercialisation enable us to further develop the  concept of academic engagement. This type of university–industry  link may take different forms, including collaborative research,  contract research and consulting, and is practiced by a far larger  proportion of academics than commercialisation. The review sug�gests that academic engagement is a multi-level phenomenon, in  the sense that it is determined by both the characteristics of indi�viduals as well as the organisational and institutional context in  which they work. Below, we synthesise our ffndings with a view to  developing a fuller understanding of this phenomenon.
";;"One needs to exercise caution  as the positive effects of engagement on scientiffc productivity are  at this stage hypothetical, because the existing research is almost  entirely based on cross-sectional analysis. The direction of causal�ity is uncertain, therefore, leaving open the possibility that good  research performance by individuals leads them to engage more.
We will return to this issue in the discussion of methodological  challenges.
";;First, our analysis suggests a partial lack of understanding  about the consequences of academic engagement. Evidence on the  impact of these collaborations on other university activities, such  as research and teaching, is scarce so it cannot be assumed that  engagement activities are always beneffcial and should therefore  be promoted. Further research on the consequences of engage�ment will allow policy-makers to derive considered judgements  as to what behaviours and organisational forms to promote, and  under which conditions they are likely to further scientiffc and/or  economic objectives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Academic engagement;;;;;;;;;;

The surveys provided independent samples of 737 innovative companies and 765 research   groups located in Andalusia.
";;. The goal of this article is to study the effec�tiveness that these stakeholders attribute to KTOs. Based on survey   data collected in the Spanish region of Andalusia, the article explores   stakeholders’ perceptions and determinants.;;"The objective of the analysis is eminently exploratory and is an attempt to understand the   factors that influence the perception of KTOs’ effectiveness. Our purpose is to trace the   factors shaping the perspectives of firms and research groups which can be attributed to   distinct organisational cultures and purposes. Nevertheless, the analysis stems from some   assumptions that are theoretically grounded and that can therefore be interpreted as work�ing hypotheses. Given the multiple influences arising from the large number of variables   available, the results are intended to explore a more refined set of hypotheses. The main   expected results are organised in a set of hypotheses related to influences on firms and a   second set related to influences on research groups.
";;;;;;;;;"H1: Firms with higher absorptive capacities tend to evaluate KTOs’ effectiveness more positively.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Knowledge transfer is considered a core process in the innovation dynamics of territories. 
Its importance has been underlined by the positive impact that ‘public science’ may have on   regional economies (Webster 1991). In many regions, R&D infrastructures and personnel   are specially concentrated in higher education institutions (HEIs). In these contexts, the   organisational interfaces that attempt to connect public science with the socioeconomic   environment are central actors of innovation systems. The main functions of organisational   interfaces for knowledge transfer are to ensure linkages between the producers of knowl�edge and the development of innovation, particularly by firms, with the expected aims of   increasing GDP, employment and social outcomes.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;In this analysis, dependent variables are used as responses to a Likert-type scale about the   perceived effectiveness of KTOs in the region (named EFFEC in our data-set). ;;;;; DIVKT: breadth of interactions. A count variable of the different channels used by   companies or research groups. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Our analysis shows that the perspectives of different stakeholders vary in the assessment   of what they consider to be an effective KTO. Our econometric results highlight the fact   that firms and research groups differ in what determines their knowledge and perceived   effectiveness of KTOs. For firms, previous knowledge of a KTO is mainly associated with   internal features, the absorptive capacity of the firm and the variety of knowledge transfer   channels used with universities. For public research groups, the scientific area and vol�ume of private R&D financing are crucial influences for engaging in knowledge transfer   activities. In terms of perception of effectiveness, the estimated models stress that both   collectives valorise the proactive engagement of KTOs as a positive element for their per�ception. Perceived effectiveness is directly dependent on the more active role of a KTO in   setting university–industry interactions.;;evertheless, it is   worth stressing the limited number of explanatory variables for the perceived effectiveness   of KTOs and that therefore these findings deserves additional attention. ;;". Future research should explore these   phenomena using different econometric approaches.

Four out of the fve   host institutions are located in the same city/province, which resulted in a high level of   proximity and cultural similarities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This paper examines the transfer of entrepreneurship education best practices from busi�ness schools to engineering and technology institutions. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"A major question that this study attempts to answer is how to transfer indigenously�developed best practices in entrepreneurship education from one institution to another. The   paper, more specifcally, tries to identify the main indicators of success (or impediments)   concerning the transfer of entrepreneurship education best practices by business schools to   engineering and technology students.

The existing litera�ture in the feld of knowledge management has investigated diferent aspects of knowledge   management in diferent conditions and contexts. Scholars have described these aspects as   knowledge creation (Nonaka 1994), knowledge sharing (Dyer and Nobeoka 2000), knowl�edge transfer (Eliufoo 2005; Argote and Ingram 2000; Tsai 2001), organizational learning   and innovation (Vakola and Rezgui 2000). Knowledge transfer is a domain of knowledge   management, which investigates the transfer of knowledge across boundaries created by   domain specialists (Carlile and Rebentisch 2003)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This paper employs the knowledge-transfer theoretical lens   using the action research methodology to understand the application of various interven�tions to transfer entrepreneurship education practices. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" Sustainable entrepreneurial ecosystems should focus on connecting people   with ideas, partners, and other resources to connect the dots in bridging assets.

It can be established that the   success of such transfers can consolidate through a long-lasting relationship between the   sender institution and the receiver institutions based on trust, collaboration, and mutual   benefts. The framework for the transfer of entrepreneurship education practices uses the   knowledge transfer theory, with a focus on communication and translation lens. It under�lines the importance of absorption capacity to capture the entrepreneurship knowledge   from a successful and proven model in a business school, which otherwise is difcult to   emulate.

Studies of innovation, conducted principally by economists, turn to the characteristics and  activity of the ffrms as their reference, while studies which focus on higher education use  universities to make their observations. Both kinds of studies apply speciffc methodolog�ical tools, and each have their advantages and disadvantages.";;;;;;"Indicator set  During the selection process for the indicators it was deemed necessary to adapt the  different possible relationships between universities and ffrms to the survey ffeld work.
First, a long list of knowledge transfer activities was created based on a review of the  literature. After doing several pre-tests, 12 were chosen. Interactions that are so speciffc  that they only correspond to a scientiffc specialty or to a sector of activity, and therefore  have very low frequencies, were added to categories of a similar collaboration type.
Nevertheless, in addition to the pre-codiffed list of indicators, the survey permitted an open  option of ‘‘other types of collaboration’’ which was assigned by the interviewer and  codiffed afterwards.
";;;;;;The indicator set considers four groups: (a) R&D activities and formal consulting work,  (b) training and transfer of personnel, (c) commercialization related to IPR, (d) other  contacts (see Table 3).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This study supplies relevant information on university–industry collaboration in a catch-up  region and some interesting observations which give cause for reffection on the suitability  and possible improvement of the Third Mission indicator systems currently in use. First,  this is a complex phenomenon which contains many variations and different scale inter�actions. When detailed indicators are used, such as in our case study, a range of diverse  interactions appear, which often are difffcult to identify and differentiate. A majority of  them have little relation to R&D activities or IPR. Thus, the ffndings support the thesis that  universities play a signiffcant role as tacit knowledge suppliers.
";;;;"At the same time, there are high levels of  heterogeneity in a regional environment. Further research is then needed on the components  and factors inffuencing the types and levels of interactions.

Renato Garcia (2019) - How long-term university-industry collaboration shapes the academic productivity of research groups;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The ffnal dataset includes 7,572 academic research groups that remained consistent  throughout the study years. The data include information regarding the research  groups’ basic characteristics, such as size, the researchers’ qualiffcations, team age,  scientiffc ffeld, location, institutional afffliation, and scientiffc production. On average,  each research group had 4 Ph.D. researchers and published 38.6 papers during the two  years priors to the 2002 census. Among the 7,572 research groups, 857 (11.3%)  collaborated with industry at least once during the studied period (Total Collab). Of  these research groups, 324 (4.3% of the sample) collaborated over the entire period,  except for the initial year (Long-term Collab). Long-term collaboration is deffned as  collaboration between research groups and industry over the entire period analysed. In  our context, collaborations represent the treatment given to individuals (i.e., academic  research groups), whereas the control research groups are non-treated individuals. To  evaluate the effect of such a treatment, we used DID.

These  beneffts may be economic, such as the provision of ffnancial resources to a research  group to access costly labs and other materials, or academic, including beneffts, such as  the exchange of information and knowledge sharing between academic researchers and  industrial scientists (Arza, 2010; Garcia et al., 2018; Perkmann & Walsh, 2009).
Collaboration with industry can provide closer contacts between industrial scientists  and academic researchers and can be a crucial source of new ideas. Thus, collaboration  can have positive effects, such as generating new ideas for research projects and  upgrading the academic research agenda (Breschi et al., 2008; Tartari & Breschi, 2012).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"From the university’s perspective, collaboration raises important concerns. The  economic beneffts of collaboration could shift academic researchers’ orientation, driv�ing such researchers away from basic research and harming academic productivity  (Breschi, Lissoni, & Montobbio, 2008; Merton, 1973; Tartari & Breschi, 2012).
Collaboration can have several potentially damaging effects on academic researchers’  behaviour by weakening their commitment to the principles of open science and  stimulating adverse behaviours, such as data withholding, secrecy and publication  delays (Partha & David, 1994). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; we examine the effect of collaboration with industry on scientiffc  productivity using data related to collaborative projects between university and indus�try. ;;;;;;;;;;long-term collaboration  with industry on scientiffc productivity. Linkages that are built on the modality of long�term joint research projects can increase the academic beneffts of collaboration since  academic researchers can deepen their understanding of the problem of their partners,  resulting in positive effects on publications and academic productivity (Rivera-Huerta  et al., 2011).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"We estimated the following regression:  Yi ¼ α þ βTi þ γti þ δ Ti  ​ ð Þþ ti εi (1)  where Y is the variable of interest; SciPapers is in the log form; T indicates the treatment  (Collaboration); δ is a measure of the treatment effect; t indicates time; and α; βandγare  the parameters.

Long-term engagement with industry can reinforce the main beneffts of collabora�tion since such engagement can strengthen trust and stimulate a deepening of the  knowledge sharing between academic researchers and their industrial partners.
Additionally, in the long term, interaction mechanisms can decrease the orientation  barriers related to the main differences between academic research and industrial R&D  and reduce transactional barriers regarding intellectual property confficts and contract  management. Our empirical results conffrm the role of this type of mechanism, which  occurs more intensively in the long term.

The requirements for developing  countries to upgrade their national systems of innovation and the role of uni�versities in supporting such systems differ from those in developed countries  INNOVATION 11
(Albuquerque, Suzigan, Kruss, & Lee, 2015; Arza, 2010). The experiences of  developing countries’ less-developed institutional and economic environments  suggest that university-industry collaborations may have different natures and  determinants in developing countries than developed countries (Moraes-Silva  et al., 2018). Thus, an important share of university-industry collaboration relies  on the diffusion and adaptation of foreign technology (Albuquerque et al., 2015;  Chaves et al., 2016; Suzigan et al., 2009). In addition, due to low private R&D  expenditures in developing countries, academic research can serve as a substitute  for ffrm investments, which can stimulate academic research to focus on applied  research. This is a limitation of our study since our results are based on a speciffc  institutional context in which the university can play a different role than that in  developed countries. This difference in the institutional context may inffuence the  effects of the long-term engagement of universities with industry on academic  productivity.

Renato Passaro (2018) - The impact of higher education on entrepreneurial intention and human capital;The impact of higher education on  entrepreneurial intention and  human capital;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"On the basis of a literature review, a theoretical model that is focused on  the theory of planned behaviour was defined to verify the impact of higher education on the development  of EI and HC. To this end, the structural equation modelling methodology was applied to two samples of  students and academics, which differ each other in terms of both education level and specific characteristics  of entrepreneurship education activities.
";;;;;;"Coherently with the explorative  nature of this research, two samples of students and academics (“university scientist, most  often a professor, sometimes a PhD student or a post-doc researcher”; Franzoni and  Lissoni, 2009, p. 1114) who were participants at a BPC with different features were invited to  complete an online questionnaire.
In particular, the samples are different in terms of:  (1) educational level (undergraduates vs a composite group made up of graduates,  master students, masters, PhD students, PhDs, post-doc, professors);  (2) specific characteristics of the EE courses (ranging from traditional theory-based vs  training-based courses, whereas students attend two-three standard curricular courses  of business economics, managerial economics and innovation management, while BPC  participants attend courses on entrepreneurship and business planning and participate  in collateral activities such as mentor and incubator meetings, pitch sessions, lean  startup workshops, meetings with entrepreneurs and/or startuppers); and  (3) position in the entrepreneurial process (students are in a phase of entrepreneurial  latency, while BPC participants have already in some way shown EI; Blanchflower  et al., 2001; Hisrich et al., 2005, Passaro et al., 2017). These differences are crucial to  verify the role of higher education on the creation of EI and ErHC.
The first sample includes students who are enrolled in the undergraduate programme in  management engineering of a university in the Campania region. The students attended  between two and three basic courses in business/managerial economics and innovation  management. A total of 128 out of 250 enrolled students (51 per cent) properly completed the  questionnaire and provided reliable feedback. The gender distribution reflects the  distribution of the students who were enrolled, with a prevalence of males (64.4 per cent).
The average respondents’ age in the sample was 23 years old (standard deviation ¼ 1.952).

This influence could reasonably  be stronger when it specifically refers to the effect of EE towards ErHC that is required to  successfully discover, identify, exploit and manage an entrepreneurial opportunity  (Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Politis, 2005; Davidsson, 2015). ErHC denotes the knowledge  base and capabilities that pertain to entrepreneurship which are developed through  business experience or continuous higher EE programmes (Rodrigues et al., 2010;  Martin et al., 2013; Sánchez, 2013).
";;;"HC is supposed to be a potential source of innovation and a key element to help firms to  face environmental uncertainty and complexity (Davidsson and Honig, 2003; Hormiga et al.,  2011; European Commission, 2012). In the context of the university system, the HC  perspective was one of the most-used theoretical frames for the prediction of a variety of  entrepreneurial behaviours such as becoming a nascent entrepreneur or self-employed,  new venture formation and performance (Markman et al., 2005; Bornemann and  Wiedenhofer, 2014; Dimov, 2017).

";;;;;;;;;;;"H1. EE positively indirectly affects EI through TPB.
";;;;;;;"Consistent with the TPB model, it is possible to state that the impact of EE on ErHC could  also be mediated by PA, behavioural aspects and social pressure (Lam, 2011; Thomas et al.,  2014; Fayolle and Gailly, 2015). Given this possibility, it could be interesting to analyse the  indirect impact of EE on ErHC using a TPB model considering such elements as the  antecedents of entrepreneurial choice. Additionally, it is known that personal features can  affect the ErHC formation process. Therefore, the analysis of the impact of EE on ErHC  using a TPB model would facilitate our understanding of the role of the PAs and other  factors";;;;"Therefore, it is quite reasonable to expect that EE is at least somewhat linked to the  positive emergence of EI and ErHC. In other words, EE is supposed to improve the specific  component of HC that is devoted to entrepreneurship (ErHC) (Martin et al., 2013) based on  the provision of appropriate knowledge, training activities and initiatives (Kolvereid and  Moen, 1997; Fayolle and Gailly, 2009; Secundo et al., 2010). Coherently, a direct link between  EE and the emergence of EI has been proposed and analysed (e.g. Souitaris et al., 2007;  Rodrigues et al., 2010; Bae et al., 2014). Finally, a relationship between EI and ErHC may  logically exist as people who demonstrate that relevant EI are more interested in enriching  their set of business and managerial competencies and skills. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;As EI is a complex and multifaceted concept, it is conceivable that some individual  reactions, as a consequence of the provision of EE, can somehow slip out from the basic  constructs of TPB. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" IC can be interpreted as a set of  intangible assets through which firms can derive competitive advantage, increase profit and  create value (Sáenz et al., 2009; Maditinos et al., 2011; Buenechea-Elberdin, 2017). It should be  emphasised that the majority of scholars agree to sustain that IC is one of the most  important resources, especially in the first steps of complex business start-up processes and  for business competitiveness and profitability (Colombo et al., 2004; Zéghal and  Maaloul, 2010; Hormiga et al., 2013).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"To join the BPC, after a six-month training period, the participants must present a business  plan with the purpose of launching a start-up. An independent judging committee awards  the best business plans with small monetary prizes. A total of 100 participants (55 per cent)  provided reliable feedback. The gender distribution reflects the distribution of the enrolled  participants, with a prevalence of males (65 per cent). The average respondents’ age in the  sample was 33 years old (standard deviation ¼ 3.574). The composition of the sample  includes assistants, associates and full professors (17 per cent), PhDs/PhD students and  fellows (4 per cent), technical staff (18 per cent), collaborators with contract/post-doc  (48 per cent) and others (13 per cent).
Therefore, according to the three above-mentioned aspects and the characteristics of  each involved group, we can derive that the components of the first sample show a lower  educational level, have attended only theory-based courses and can be considered to be  latent or potential entrepreneurs, by occupying very initial positions along the ideal  entrepreneurial process that precedes start-up. Conversely, the components of the second  group show a higher educational level, have also attended training/practice-based courses  and have taken part in entrepreneurship-driven collateral activities during a six-month  training period of the BPC. Moreover, the latter can be considered to be intentional  entrepreneurs as they have decided to participate in a BPC that is oriented to support a  business start-up, which thus shows a more robust EI. In other words, considering the  entrepreneurial process, the BPC participants can be positioned closer to the nascent  entrepreneur position.
The questionnaires were administered through a website. In both of the groups, many  respondents (an average of 22 per cent between the two samples) were excluded due to a  high rate of item nonresponses or unit nonresponses.
";;;;;;"EE was measured with a set of nine questions that were identified by reviewing the  literature on the impact of the educational activities on both HC and EI (Zhao et al.,  2005; Fayolle et al., 2009; Martin et al., 2013). The nine questions aim to measure the  knowledge base, parents’ education and skills acquired in education programmes.
• PBC was measured with a set of six items that were defined on the basis of a  literature review on EI (Liñán and Chen, 2009; Liñán et al., 2011). The items aim to  measure the perception of the ease or difficulty of becoming an entrepreneur,  self-efficacy and perceived feasibility (Ajzen, 2002).
• SN was assessed through three questions that were defined by reviewing the literature  on EI (Ajzen, 2002; Liñán and Chen, 2009; Liñán et al. 2011). The item aims to evaluate  the perceived social pressure in engaging in (or not engaging in) entrepreneurial  behaviours. In other words, it refers to the perception that “reference people” would  approve of the decision to become an entrepreneur, or not (Ajzen, 2002).

• PA was measured by means of four items that were defined on the basis of a  literature review on EI (Liñán and Chen, 2009; Liñán et al. 2011). These questions  were designed to analyse the degree to which the individual has a positive or  negative personal valuation of being (or becoming) an entrepreneur (Ajzen, 2002;  Kolvereid and Isaksen, 2005).
• EI was assessed by a set of three items that aim to measure the effort that an  individual will make to pursue an entrepreneurial career. The questions are the same  as Liñán and Chen’s (2009) and Liñán et al.’s (2011) EIQ.
• ErHC was analysed through six items that were defined on the basis of the literature  review on IC and its antecedents ( Peña, 2002; Choong, 2008; Martin et al., 2013).
The questions aim to measure the level of the (entrepreneurship-related) skills and  competences that are possessed by interviewees.
";;;;"According to one of the most-adopted EI model, Ajzen’s (1991) TPB, an individual’s  intention to engage in the entrepreneurial process is positively shaped by three main  constructs: personal attitude (PA) towards entrepreneurship (the degree to which the  individual holds a positive or negative personal valuation with regard to the adoption of  that behaviour); subjective norms (SN) (the perceived social pressure to engage in or not  engage in specific entrepreneurial behaviour); perceived behavioural control (also referred to  as self-efficacy, intended as the subjective perception of the feasibility of assuming  entrepreneurial behaviour).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The main results show that there are significant differences between the two considered samples.
In particular, the level and specific characteristics of entrepreneurial education are the key factors for the  development of EI and HC.
";;"This study shows some limitations. First, the samples investigated are dimensionally limited  and only refer to people who live in a specific Italian region. Second, the individuals who  answered to the questionnaire may have different perceptions with respect to those who did  not answer, and there would be no guarantee that the respondents are representative of the  population. In other words, for practical purposes a non-probability method of sampling was  used, and therefore the final results could not be viewed as representative of the populations.
Third, the content and features of the EE courses that were attended by the participants are  university specific. Such limitations are in line with the explorative nature of this work and  contribute to reduce the generalisability of the results.
In addition, the research does not include longitudinal data to control the change of EI over  time. Furthermore, no pre-tests were performed prior to the exposure to EE courses for  individuals with higher levels of EI. These limits call for additional field studies and the  extension of the sample analysis to universities from other Italian regions or different countries.
In spite of these limitations, this paper confirms the importance of EE as a key driver  to develop both the intention towards start-ups and entrepreneurship-related HC assets to  trigger the aforementioned virtuous circle.
";;"An essential research agenda of this paper can be addressed to replicate or extend the  field investigation in the following directions: to combine the two samples and then  distinguish groups of individuals according to their education level by using a categorical  variable in an SEM or by adopting a cluster analysis approach; to perform a comparative  analysis with a new control sample that is composed of academics who did not participate in  the BPC to investigate additional factors other than educational level and the impact of  specific characteristics on EI and ErHC; to increase the sample size and to consider  additional regional contexts; and to deepen the mechanisms and variables able to influence  the direct relationship between EE and EI.

Research on the Patent Innovation Performance of University Industry Collaboration Based on Complex Network Analysis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Methodology: The authors based their research on a platform of nano-biopharma�ceuticals complex network analysis. Furthermore, they built a network to analyze the  inffuence of small-world properties, as well as the impact of the largest component  on the patent value of innovation activities at a corporate level. In this article, the  authors conduct an empirical investigation of university–industry patent innovation  collaboration in the nano-biopharmaceutical ffeld and propose that their research  be considered as new evidence in addition to the previously published literature in  this ffeld. Given the pre-existing high skew of patent values in relation to registered  patents, they used weighted patent value in the measurement of university–industry  innovation performance, rather than simple patent counts.

Similarly, accessibility to the needed technological resources is highly important to the  EPU (Farsi et al., 2012; Guerrero and Urbano, 2012). The EPU typically initiates agreements  with the industry and the government that require the latter to provide the EPU with the  needed technological equipment in return for transferring the results of EPU research into  the industry’s production facilities and government output (Bratianu and Stanciu, 2010).
";;" The “entrepreneurial university” (EPU) emerged carrying  the flag of entrepreneurship as the third mission (Etzkowitz, 1983). The EPU is defined as  the university that seeks to stimulate innovation and entrepreneurship through knowledge  creation and transfer, propagating the new function of economic and social development as  an integrated university function much as research was integrated with teaching at an  earlier stage (Etzkowitz, 2013). Gibb (2013) further describes the EPU as an institution  designed to empower its constituents to demonstrate innovation in teaching, research and  the use and transfer of knowledge across boundaries. Through creating and transferring  knowledge to the industry and government, producing frame-breaking innovations and  taking risks that are backed by science, the EPU could make significant contributions  to economic growth (Mavi, 2014). Bramwell and Wolfe (2008) suggest that, beyond  producing commercializable knowledge and expert researchers, EPUs generate and  attract talented human capital to the local economy, and provide formal and informal  technical support to local industry, highlighting the various ways that EPUs contribute to  their local context.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The EPU  presented a new model of collaboration and interdependence among the university itself, the  industry and the government, seeking new sources of funding in exchange for research and  innovation. Since then, many studies have explored the mission, characteristics and  dynamics of the EPU (Clark, 1998; Etzkowitz, 1993; Wasser, 1990), falling short of reaching a  consensus over a common definition (Kirby et al., 2011).
In the Triple Helix paradigm (Etzkowitz, 2013), the EPU embraces its interactive – rather  than linear – model of innovation and knowledge transfer, leading to the adoption of the  “third mission” of socio-economic development, in addition to the traditional missions of  teaching and research. Here, the EPU is seen as serving the purpose of promoting economic  growth (Etzkowitz and Zhou, 2008), and highlighting the general functions of innovation,  risk-taking, teamwork and responsiveness to arising challenges (Kirby et al., 2011) which, in  developing nations, are numerous. It follows that the Triple Helix model serves as the most  suitable theoretical framework for this particular study.

(Scale selection table was uploaded separately.);;;;;;;;;;Entrepreneurship environment. This dimension describes the local business and regulatory  environment as it pertains to promoting entrepreneurial behavior. Based on institutional  theory, Scott (2014) highlighted the importance of the environment in which the university is  embedded, emphasizing the institutions that surround the university, affect it and are  affected by it. Scott (2014) describes it as “attending to the larger drama, rather than to the  individual player” referring to the need to situate the EPU within its relevant context rather  that examine it in isolation (p. 262).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"It was important to assess the reliability and validity of the measurement model which  depicted the relationships among the latent constructs and their respective indicators (Hair  et al., 2012). First, the authors examined composite reliability, a suitable measure of  reliability in PLS (Ringle et al., 2014). The values of composite reliability exceeded the  recommended 0.7 (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994), and ranged between 0.765 and 0.861,  indicating that the scales had adequate consistency (Gefen et al., 2000).
As another measure of internal consistency, Cronbach’s α for each scale was also  computed and reported in Table I. Though most of Cronbach’s α scores were W0.7  (Nunnally, 1978), some were less than this threshold, which was considered acceptable given  the nature of this exploratory study where Cronbach’s α scores between 0.6 and 0.7 are  considered non-problematic (Hair et al., 1999).
Next, convergent validity was assessed by validating that the factor loadings (in the  outer loadings table of SmartPLS output) exceeded the recommended minimum of 0.5  (Hulland, 1999). These loadings ranged between 0.60 and 0.82, thus constituting a measure  of convergent validity. Next, the authors calculated the average variance extracted (AVE)  scores which were above the 0.5 cutoff, ranging between 0.50 and 0.592 and confirming  convergent validity (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The results of data analysis confirmed the influence of resources and capabilities and knowledge  transfer as the two most powerful “university-specific” success factors. Importantly, the relationship between  the university-specific factors and innovation was mediated by the presence of a strong entrepreneurial  culture, while an entrepreneurship environment was found to be conducive to entrepreneurship outcomes of  the EPU.
";;As all other studies, this study had several limitations, the most significant of which was  the sample. The authors were not able to secure respondents from all initially targeted  universities. Some universities refused to participate in the study, while others required  lengthy procedures and demanding requirements. This caused a few universities to be  excluded from the sample. Another limitation was that the sample was drawn from one  country only. It is suggested that future studies pursuing this line of research extend the  study to include other developing countries in and outside the region, so as to reach more  generalizable results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Hence, since the 1980s,   a growing number of universities have embraced economic and social development as   part of their mission, giving birth to the so-called entrepreneurial university (hereaf�ter, EU) (Etzkowitz 1983), in other words, a university which incorporates “economic   development (…) as an academic function along with teaching and research” (Etzkowitz   1998, p. 833).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The academic entrepreneurial spirit that has emerged in universities, together with   the creative and productive coexistence of this new function with the traditional func�tions of higher education institutions (teaching and research), have positioned universi�ties as equal partners in their relationship with industry and government. These relations   are crucial to innovation in a knowledge-based economy (Etzkowitz 2003a), and based   on them, a model was developed that explains the innovation process: the triple helix   model (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorf 1997). In this model, each of the three institutions   or helices (university, industry, and government) interact with each other and establish   diverse bilateral and trilateral relations to support the generation of new knowledge   and its transfer, and this way contribute to regional and national economic develop�ment (Clark 1998; Etzkowitz 1998, 2003a; Motohashi 2005).

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Cluster 1: triple helix model  The key concept in the Triple Helix approach is precisely the EU and its role in the knowl�edge society (Etzkowitz 1983).
The transformation process, which many universities are currently undergoing, began   at the end of the 19th century with the so-called frst academic revolution that incor�porated research as part of the university’s mission, alongside teaching. At the end of   the 20th century, the second academic revolution took place when the third mission   emerged: the university’s contribution to regional and national economic development   (Etzkowitz 1983, 1998). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Cluster 3: globalized perspective  Globalization is one of the factors that can help explain the transformation of universi�ties into entrepreneurial organizations. This transformation requires a set of changes which   involve searching for and using new ways of funding; implementing organizational and   cultural changes; adopting managerial practices, values, and techniques from the feld of   business; competing to attract international students; and introducing changes in the rules   and working practices of researchers, as well as new forms of teaching by means of ICTs   (Deem 2001; Stromquist 2007; Lam 2010).
";;;;"Cluster 2: knowledge society  The set of works that are framed within this second cluster explore the way in which   EUs contribute to regional and national development. In this regard, Guerrero et  al. 
(2015) argue that EUs contribute to the economic growth of their environment by gen�erating human capital, knowledge capital, and entrepreneurship capital, these resources   being the result of the teaching, research, and entrepreneurial activities they undertake.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; The frst one focuses on the triple helix model, i.e., on the bilateral and tri�lateral relations between industry, university, and government. These relations account for   a new model of innovation, where the three actors can participate in the diferent phases of   innovation processes and even assume the role traditionally held by any of the others. ;;"Moreover, there are still issues that need to be examined in more depth to further our   understanding of the EU. To this end, the EU could be studied from diferent theories and   theoretical approaches, both from the feld of management and from other areas such as   psychology or sociology. Another line of research could analyze whether diferences exist   between the economic and social impact of the entrepreneurial university as opposed to the   impact of traditional universities.

Universities play a crucial and highly complex role in enriching society   that goes way beyond technology-transfer indicators, not least their crucial role in producing   human capital and undertaking basic research. Therefore, attempting to turn universities   into quasi-economic development agencies seems a highly reductionist policy objective.;;;;"In terms of potential future policy instruments, some have argued for a more entre�preneurial role for the state (Mazzucato 2016, this issue). Towards this end, steps such   as enhancing the absorptive capacity of existing small firms seems a more suitable goal   for innovation policy, especially for peripheral regions with limited innovative capacity. 
Promoting networking and knowledge exchange between SMEs and other actors both   local and further afield should become more central methods for promoting innovation. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

";;;;;;;The main aim of this paper is to identify and  discuss the limitations to the current measurements of university–industry KT  performance, and propose some directions for improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;We argue that  university–industry KT can unfold in many ways and impact many stakeholders,  and that, especially in highly differentiated university systems, choosing  indicators focused on a narrow range of activities and impacts might limit the  ability of universities to accurately represent their KT performance. ;;;;;;;cope of the deffnition can be more or less broad (Kelly 2008). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The HE-BCI survey is addressed to all universities in the UK.

We have illustrated this with reference to  the case of the UK. We have debated that the choice of indicators in the HE-BCI  survey, while wider than in other surveys, is still not sufffciently broad in terms of  the types of activities and types of impact considered. As a consequence, this raises  issues of comparability between institutions, and potentially introduces undesirable be�havioural incentives whereby universities may be encouraged to increase their involve�ment in KT activities where engagement and impact are measured appropriately, to the  detriment of other KT activities which are not measured as well but which may be  equally important. ;;;"What are possible avenues for improvement? It would be appropriate to consider  more composite ways to measure KT performance, including a broader range of activi�ties and more varied ways to measure impact besides the income generated. Some of the  indicators included should be directed at capturing qualitative aspects of KT, and the  feedback effects of KT activities on universities. In order to choose indicators that  are not biased in favour of institutions that adopt speciffc KT proffles, a possible  approach could be to recognise that institutions are different and may require different  sets of indicators, for example by developing a very broad range of indicators represent�ing all possible activities, and allowing universities to choose the indicators that best fft  their KT proffle (adopting a ffexible approach to measurement as suggested in the more  general case of innovation policy indicators by Rafols et al. 2012). Alternatively, the  information from KT surveys such as the HE-BCI may be utilised to a greater extent  by government agencies to identify initial proffles of universities, and act as an  initial step in proffling KT engagement.

Sara Neves (2020) - Academic entrepreneurship intentions a systematic literature review;;;;;;;;;;"The paper follows a Systematic Literature Review process (Tranfield  et al., 2003) and adopts a four-step process format from previous literature reviews within the entrepreneurship  context (Miller et al., 2018). From the results within Scopus and Web of Science databases, this research  selected, evaluated, summarised and synthesised 66 relevant papers.
";;"The first step involved search terms identification. The keyword search strategy started with  a brainstorm, as suggested in the work by Pittaway et al. (2004). The keywords identified by  the authors fell into three clusters: context (university and academy), activities (for example,  knowledge transfer, spin-off, industry collaboration, patents) and academic action (for  example, intention, behaviour, engagement). After this, a search on Scopus was performed  using the same keywords as in Lin~​an and Fayolle (2015) ‘entrepren*’ and ‘intent*’ in  combination with ‘academ*’ and ‘universit*.’ Highest citations sorted the results. The final  step included the extraction of the titles and abstracts of the one hundred most cited papers to  an online word count software to adjust and validate the previously identified keywords.
After the initial search terms identification, a search for titles, abstracts and keywords  was conducted in April 2019 in Scopus and Web of Science bibliographical databases.

From the psychological perspective, two fundamental  research strands emerge from the literature: Shapero’s (1984) Entrepreneurial Event Model  and Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). This research adopts the TPB  framework given its numerous advantages (Cantner et al., 2017; Lortie and Castogiovanni,  2015; Sieger and Monsen, 2015), ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Academic entrepreneurship;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The objective of this research is to have an up-to-date and comprehensive assessment of the current  knowledge regarding the variables that encourage the individuals, within the academic community, to get  involved in knowledge exploitation activities. ;;;;;;;;;;;This research will help answer the  questions: ‘What are the drivers of academic entrepreneurial intentions?’ and ‘What are the  emerging topics for future research?’;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Equally important, when setting up a  conceptual model of academic entrepreneurial intentions, it is essential to include the  economic perspective (Goethner et al., 2012; Huyghe and Knockaert, 2016; Wurmseher, 2017 € ).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"From the results of the previous step, the search used a combination of different keywords:  ‘university’ and ‘academy.’ The same terms were selected as keywords in the reviews from  Hayter et al. (2018) and Perkmann et al. (2013): ‘entrepreneurship’, ‘startup’, ‘spinoff’ and  ‘spinout’ (Djokovic and Souitaris, 2008; Sandstr€om et al., 2018). To capture the university�industry activities, the keywords ‘industry,’ ‘business’ and ‘firm’ were jointly selected with  ‘interaction,’ ‘collaboration’ and ‘cooperation’ following a similar approach as adopted by  Sj€o€o and Hellstr€om (2019). Moreover, as performed in the systematic review by Zavale and  Langa (2018), the keywords ‘partnership’ and ‘relationship’ were added.
Furthermore, the terms ‘technology,’ ‘research’ and ‘knowledge’ were included in  combination with the terms ‘transfer,’ ‘commercialisation’ and ‘patent’ (Gerbin and Drnovsek,  2016), plus ‘license’ (Rothaermel et al., 2007), ‘joint’ and ‘contract’ (Perkmann et al., 2013).
Finally, as the research goal is to comprehend the intentions, the equivalent keywords  ‘intention,’ ‘attitude,’ ‘behaviour,’ ‘motivation’ and ‘engagement’ were counted in. The search  strings using Boolean ‘and’ to join main terms and ‘or’ to include synonyms were constructed  (for the full list of keywords strings see Appendix 1).
The timescale limits the period to 2007–2018 (Clauss et al., 2018; Pittaway and Cope, 2007).
Papers that include the mentioned combination of keywords in Title, Abstract, or Keywords  constitute the research target.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This study provides a factor-listed representation of the individual, organisational and  institutional variables that should be considered in the strategies defined by the university. Moreover, the  study concludes that the push factors behind the intentions are multiple, context-dependent, hierarchy�dependent, heterogeneous and, at the same time, dependent on each other and against each other. Lastly, the  study contributes to academic entrepreneurship literature, especially entrepreneurial intention literature,  which has recently received more researchers’ attention.
";;"From the findings in this study, there is a lack of coherence in the literature, and it is worth  studying whether, as age increases, academics’ intentions also increase. The authors believe  that studying age together with networks, scientific productivity and entrepreneurial  experience may offer clarifications on age behaviour. Secondly, further clarification is also  required regarding the concept of scientific productivity. The literature empirically  demonstrates positive, negative and mixed outcomes. It would be interesting to devote  some research within different contexts to understand if the academics who excel in scientific  domains are also the most entrepreneurial. This factor is indirectly linked with academics’  personal attitude and perceived behavioural control. Lastly, the research subject on academic  entrepreneurship could benefit from a deeper understanding of the effects of moral  motivations, either the moral duty to society, welfare, well-being or community, in intentions.
";;"Although outside the scope of  this investigation, it would be interesting for future research to enhance this list with  measurable items and validate a scale. For the practitioners, this list can be used by university  managers, TTOs and department managers, and policymakers to guide questionnaires or  interviews to analyse their academics’ intentions and adequately support its academic  engagement strategy.

A methodology for interaction models is used in order to identify determinants of  knowledge interactions.

In this study, university departments  are chosen as reporting units. The main source for  empirical analysis is a survey of all departments at  Austrian universities on various types of knowledge  interactions with ffrms. The heads of all departments  were asked to provide information on the following  nine types of personal-contact-based knowledge inter�actions with the side of the industry (the reference pe�riod being 1995–1998):  • the number of collaborative research projects, car�ried out together with ffrms,  • the number of scientiffc publications, jointly written  with ffrm members,  • the number of researchers from their department,  who changed to ffrms for the purpose of R&D ac�tivities (either temporarily or permanently),  • the number of technology-oriented ffrms, founded  by researchers from their department,  • the number of Ph.D. theses and the number of Mas�ters theses, jointly supervised with ffrm members or  carried out at ffrms,  • the number of lectures by ffrm members, given at  their university department,  • the number of training courses for ffrm members,  offered by their university department,  • the number of research assistants, employed at their  department and ffnanced by ffrms.

Spin-offs are associated with a bi-directional  ffow of knowledge if the university researcher remains  at least partly assigned to the university but with a  uni-directional if this is not the case. The joint super�vision of Ph.D. and Masters theses is likely to involve  knowledge ffows that are somewhat biased.

A main purpose  is to explore the signiffcance of the use of different  channels of knowledge interactions between univer�sity and industry and the sectoral differences which  may occur. These sectoral differences in knowledge  interactions are assumed to depend on size effects,  proximity effects (i.e. technological proximity be�tween university research and technology develop�ment in industry), and sector speciffc performance and  structures. ;;;;;;The potential economic  value of knowledge affects the way, knowledge is ex�changed between actors, too, demanding for know�ledge interactions, which ensure secrecy, increase trust  between actors and allow for exclusive appropriation  of knowledge (Saviotti, 1998). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"the intensity and types of performed R&D  and the associated types of innovation processes dif�fer among the sectors of economic activity.

Especially so-called science-based industries  (see Meyer-Krahmer and Schmoch, 1998) heavily  rely on new scientiffc knowledge and should show  more intense interactions with universities.

";;;;;;Experience in external R&D collaboration of a  ffeld of science: If there is a level of experience in  external, industry-oriented knowledge interactions  in a certain ffeld of science, institutional and indi�vidual barriers to knowledge interactions are likely  to be less important than in the case of ffelds of  science with little experiences so far. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Size structure of a ffeld of science: The size structure  of a ffeld of science (measured in terms of average  academic staff per department) may strongly affect  the resources available for R&D projects aside from  day-to-day tasks (such as the education of students  and organisational tasks).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Although the results show a number of peculiarities  which can be addressed to the particular situation in  Austria as a small and open economy with a predom�inantly small and medium-sized ffrm structure, there  are some results which may be viewed as general  patterns of knowledge interaction between university  and industry.
Apparently, universities and the industry use a va�riety of channels in order to transfer knowledge. The  channels vary in the intensity of personal relations,  in the types of knowledge transferred and in the di�rection of the knowledge ffow. From the viewpoint  of industry, the use of different channels represents  varying strategies to ensure research efffciency, allows  access to different types of scientiffc and technologi�cal knowledge and reffects differences in demand for  knowledge in different stages of innovation. Sectors  of economic activity and ffelds of science engage in  different types of interactions.";; In many cases, indicators  concentrate on only a few types of interactions such as  research contracts and patent applications. Our results  suggest to widen the set of indicators and consider  knowledge interactions such as training, personnel  mobility, start-ups as well as other forms of personal  contacts more seriously. In the area of public pro�motion programmes for industry–university relations  there is a strong focus on supporting cooperation in  research projects. ;;"While there is no doubt that know�ledge exchange in direct research collaboration is one  of the most effective transfer channels, other types of  interaction should not be underestimated in their role  in innovation processes which demand different types  of knowledge. In the design of research and tech�nology policy, barriers to industry–university interac�tions in other areas than direct research cooperation  should be taken into account and addressed in effec�tive ways as well.

The term  “entrepreneurial university” (Etzkowitz, 1983) has been adopted by academics and  policymakers to describe universities that effectively deliver on their “third mission” (Clark,  1998; Lambert, 2003). Sometimes third mission refers to all the activities not included as first  or second mission or in other cases “any activity that universities perform in relation to  ‘external environments” (E3M, 2010, p. 15). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Entrepreneurial universities have emerged as central economic actors playing an active role in  promoting teaching, innovation, knowledge transfer, and entrepreneurship (Urbano and  Guerrero, 2013). Over the past 30 years, it has been observed that some significant changes  in the structure and mission of TTOs have occurred (Siegel and Wright, 2015), paralleled by  the emergence of TTO performance measures. Such measures generally reflect the efficiency  of the TTO i.e. their ability to convert inputs into outputs (Thursby and Kemp, 2002; Thursby  and Thursby, 2002; Siegel et al., 2003; Chapple et al., 2005; Schoen et al., 2014) and typically  rely upon tangible performance metrics such as patents, licenses and spin-off company  creation and other proxies for return on investment (ROI).

This study involves the use of the metric  through the completion of an online survey and follow-up interviews, to collect and analyse the data.
";;"Successful promotion of academic entrepreneurship is a determining factor in the pursuit of  university entrepreneurialism. This paper aims to illustrate how qualitative data on the performance of the  technology transfer office (TTO), based on access to intellectual capital (IC) indicators, can be  transformed into a metric to provide insights that assist in strategy development for a university moving  towards a more entrepreneurial configuration.
";;;;;;;;;;;"Q1. How can insights, derived from the performance of the TTO, aid the university in the  pursuit of entrepreneurialism?
";;;;;;; In this pursuit, entrepreneurial universities have often opted to establish  technology transfer offices (TTOs) or similar intermediary units (Hsu et al., 2015). The TTO is  the catalyst of the technology transfer process from university research to commercial  application and enables the transfer of implicit knowledge, codified or non-codified know�how, and technology to create wealth and to increase economic development (Tahvanainen  and Hermans, 2011). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Wood (2011) provides a holistic definition of academic entrepreneurship, moving from the  premise that academic entrepreneurship is not a single event, but rather a continuous  process comprised of a series of events (Friedman and Silberman, 2003). ;;"Some of these activities, namely, technology transfer,  innovation, commercialisation and entrepreneurial endeavour, are known collectively as  “academic entrepreneurship” activities (Rothaermel et al., 2007; Siegel and Wright, 2015).
There has been an emergence of “entrepreneurial universities” (Guerrero et al., 2015;  Guerrero et al., 2016) within which academics, in the pursuit of increasing  entrepreneurialism, engage in academic entrepreneurship.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The role of a university has expanded from teaching (first mission), to research (second  mission) towards entrepreneurship (third mission) (Redford and Fayolle, 2014). The  activities associated with the university third mission include (non-exhaustively) technology  transfer and innovation, continuing education, social engagement and economic and social  development (Guan and Zhao, 2013). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"2.3 The intellectual capital-based technology transfer office performance metric  IC is already widely adopted by the industry in assessing performance, so Secundo et al.
(2017b) have argued in favour of also using IC as a performance measure for  entrepreneurial universities because:   IC can represent the potential of the entrepreneurial university to achieve its stated  main mission and performance objectives;   the identification of IC can improve the value creation process, moving the university  towards being more entrepreneurial; and   IC enhances transparency, which is needed to ensure successful university-industry  cooperation because IC provides a means by which industry can assess the potential/  ability of a university to be entrepreneurial and create linkages, which could be of  mutual benefit to both parties.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The range of activities TTOs are involved in is ever-expanding. This is because the  university defines the mission statement of its TTO, sets the TTO’s objectives, assigns the  funds for TTO activities and defines the TTO’s organisational relationships with other  university structures i.e. defining governance structures (Huyghe et al., 2014). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"There is, however, dissatisfaction among technology transfer professionals due to the over�simplified metrics applied to their efforts e.g. the concept ROI measures only short-term  benefits (Faulkner, 1996). Considering the need for universities to make a wider contribution  to society as articulated above, it is clear that TTO performance metrics need a rethink to  encompass the greater scope of activity that is undertaken today.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;Building upon Secundo et al. (2016, 2017a), we use the TTO performance metric in an online,  self-assessment survey. We sent the survey to university TTOs or similar intermediary units in  continental Europe and the UK. ;"To recap, the aim of this paper is to illustrate how an IC-based TTO performance metric,  could be applied so as to support a university’s entrepreneurial efforts. Methodologically,  we have taken the Secundo et al. (2016, 2017a) performance metric, which highlighted 6  thematic areas, which influence the performance of TTOs and identified proxy indicators for  each of these.

The indicators, as embodied in their corresponding IC  classifications, were rewritten as a statement and respondents were asked to indicate the";"level of their agreement with 24 statements on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from  “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” (Kalar and Antoncic, 2015).

This, in turn, may result in  increased academic entrepreneurship activities, which will drive the university towards increased  entrepreneurialism.
";;" Future work will further explore these proxy indicators to determine how  universities may position themselves, and their TTO as the main body for academic  entrepreneurship, strategically to enhance entrepreneurial activity. However, these findings  are a good indication of the appropriateness of using the TTO as a unit of observation in  assessing entrepreneurialism within the university.

Secundo 2019 - Knowledge spillover creation in university-based entrepreneurial ecosystem;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"we adopt a case study   approach (Yin, 2013) that is in general suitable for   researching “how” or “why” questions and for the   analysis of a contemporary phenomenon in its natural   setting.
The case study approach is a methodology well   consolidated for qualitative research (Piekkari et al.,   2010) because it has been demonstrated to be appro�priate for building theory in contemporary events that   cannot be controlled by researchers (Eisenhardt,   1989). This approach embraces a simple observation   of the social phenomena and a direct interpretation by   the researchers (Crotty, 1998), with the generation of   different alternatives according to the different   researchers’ perspectives (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).

This results in a broad   portfolio of entrepreneurial activities (Kalar &   Antoncic, 2015) such as entrepreneurial mindset   development, spin-offs, technology transfer, social   and economic growth, research commercialisation,   and support for the creation of new ventures   (Bonaccorsi et al., 2013; Etzkowitz & Klofsten, 2005;   O’Shea et al., 2007).

The most direct extrapolation from biology to   business is seen in the early work of Moore (1993,   p. 26), which describes the ecosystem as “an economic   community supported by a foundation of interacting   organisations and individuals”. ;;;"The creation of a university-based entrepreneurial   ecosystem is a key element of the entrepreneurial uni�versity (Clark, 1998; Etzkowitz, 1983) that happens   through the diffusion of an entrepreneurial culture   through the development of entrepreneurship courses   and programmes on campus with the involvement of   external stakeholders (Hahn et al., 2019; Wright et al.,   2017). It facilitates knowledge transfer and contributes   to the creation of new ventures through the entrepre�neurship education activities (Bonaccorsi et al., 2013;   Etzkowitz, 2016; Etzkowitz & Klofsten, 2005; O’Shea   et al., 2007). It is worth noting that the entrepreneurial   university is an entity involved in social change and   economic growth (Etzkowitz, 1983; Ferreira &   Carayannis, 2019; Foss & Gibson, 2015; Guerrero   et al., 2016; Klofsten et al., 2019; Perkmann et al.,   2013).

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"UICs are a phenomenon that has become more common over the last decade as these  collaborations have become more formalised. The intention of these partnerships is to close  the gap between industry and academia (Lai, 2011). One key area in any discussion on UICs is  the cost and benefits to the involved party. If the correct incentive is not established for all  parties involved, then a partnership will be difficult to establish. If one is established without,  the risk of failure is higher due to mismatched motivation. Wynn et al. (2019) argue that UICs  are key in support of entrepreneurial activity. Santoro and Bierly (2006) assessed the  effectiveness of the facilitators of the transfer. They found university research centres (URCs)  needed to safeguard against intellectual property policies from obstructing knowledge  transfer.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;"The term value proposition has become a mainstream marketing expression, however the  true meaning and the benefit created from having strategic value propositions is often lost  (Lanning, 2003). Payne and Frow (2014) argue that the lack of specificity and strategic  development of a superior value proposition is a major impediment to marketplace success. It  is therefore important to understand how a value proposition is defined, discussed and  implemented in a business context. Lanning and Michaels’ (1988) early definition of a value  proposition still holds – a value proposition combines benefit and price to share a promise of  value to a customer. Value is therefore a point of differentiation on which to sell into a market.
In more recent years, this promise has been expanded to include a greater combination of  values including price, quality, performance, selection and convenience (Payne and Frow,  2014). According to Woulters and Kirchberger (2015) ‘a customer value proposition is a  supplier’s statement of the value its offering provides to a customer’ (p. 56). Vargo and Lusch  (2004), use the term ‘value-in-use’ where the value is only truly created through the  consumption of a purchase.

";;"Limitations  One of the limitations of the study is that action research and case studies are not always  repeatable if the same process were to be applied to a different company. This problem is not  just limited to the methodology but also to TT in general. The barriers that can be seen in TT  partnerships are in some instances going to cause failures in the longevity of knowledge  injected into a given company (de Wit-de Vries et al., 2019). Another limitation comes from the  potential of researcher bias. Action research calls for the researcher to immerse themself in  the study and to change with the process. While this helps to gather rich data, there is the  potential for subjective feelings to influence the case study.

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The conceptual framework for this paper is built around two  key notions. First, knowledge and technology are distinct con�structs such that each type of transfer entails different kinds of  activities, is often undertaken by different personnel within the  organization, and involves different kinds of interactions and  procedures [2], [5]. Second, while knowledge transfer and tech�nology transfer are different, both are important value-creating  activities that occur over time and within the rubric of certain  organizational factors that are related to and important for in�terorganizational collaboration [49]. ;;;;;;;"an organization’s structure  can be classified on three dimensions: 1) number of hierarchical  levels; 2) extent to which knowledge and control are concentrated  at the top of the organization (centralization); and 3) the degree  to which rules and policies are adhered to (formalization).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Knowledge is much broader than a particular technology.
Knowledge includes scientific, mathematical, physical, and  social/behavioral theories and principles [59], some of which is  not currently put to use or readily quantifiable [58]. Moreover,  knowledge captures the underlying cause and effect relation�ships on which a technology is constructed and embedded [58]  and accommodates exceptions, adaptations, and unforeseen  events ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;At the core of our argument, we suggest that while technology  is derived from certain types of knowledge, technology is more  a tool, or a set of tool systems for transforming the environment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In order to obtain a sample of industrial firms working  with university research centers, a variety of research centers  in prominent public and private U.S. universities were con�tacted. Twenty-nine university research centers were originally  contacted. These 29 centers were a random sample of ERCs,  IUCRCs, and non-NSF supported university research centers  selected from an overall list of 36 such centers. Thus, the  29 centers originally contacted represented 80% of the total  sample. Twenty-one centers of the 29 agreed to participate in  this study. Those centers opting not to participate declined due  to time and resource constraints. The 21 participating univer�sity research centers provided complete lists of their corporate  partners, including the names, addresses, and phone numbers  of all members in the firm working with the research center. A  survey questionnaire was then mailed to each industrial firm  representative identified.
";;;;;;;;;;"Organizational culture is a complex construct consisting of  many concepts, most notable among them, shared values [3],  [50] and shared meanings [14], [34]. Culture is important since  it influences the actions of organizational members by imposing  a repertoire of habits and values [22]. According to Peters and  Waterman [42] shared values embody the broad notions of di�rection that top managers want to infuse into the organization.
As such, organizational culture represents the third “S” in the  7-S framework, i.e., shared values.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"4) Stable and Direction-Oriented Culture: Following  Denison and Mishra [15] a four-item scale (alpha 0.84)  was used to represent the strength of the firm’s consistency  and sense of mission that are the two elements of a stable and  direction-oriented culture. The following were the four items  measured:  a) firm’s consistency and predictability in their approach to  doing business;  b) extent of member agreement regarding the way in which  things are done;  c) extent to which the firm has a long-term purpose and clear  direction for the future;  d) extent to which firm members have a shared vision re�garding what the organization will be like in the future.
";;;;;;;;;"5) Flexible and Change-Oriented Culture: Following  Denison and Mishra [15] a four-item scale (alpha 0.78)  was used to represent the strength of the firm’s involvement  and adaptability that are the two elements of a flexible and  change-oriented culture. The following were the four items  measured:  a) extent of member participation in decisions;  b) extent of member cooperation and collaboration across  functional roles;  c) firm’s willingness and capacity for internal change in re�sponse to external environmental conditions;  d) extent to which customers’ comments and recommenda�tions drive changes in the firm.
";;;1) Knowledge Transfer Activities: Our first dependent vari�able was measured by an eight-item scale (alpha 0.91). Since  strategy refers to the actions firms engage in to create compet�itive advantage, these eight items concentrate on interpersonal  activities that the firm engaged in with the university research  center to understand, leverage, and exploit underlying princi�ples in the pre-and post-competitive phases of technological ad�vancement. ;3) Organization Structure: This variable was measured by  a three-item scale (alpha 0.75). Following Burns and Stalker  [7], organization structure was represented by number of hier�archical levels within the firm, the extent to which members  follow directives (extent of centralization), and the extent to  which the firm has rigid rules and policies (extent of formal�ization).;;;;;2) Technology Transfer Activities: Our second dependent  variable was also extracted through principal components  factor analysis (with an Eigenvalue of 4.5) and was measured  by a five-item scale (alpha 0.92).;"6) Trust: This continuous variable was measured using a  three-item scale (alpha 0.70). Following Mayer et al. [35],  trust was measured by  a) the extent to which industrial firm participants were  willing to share ideas, feelings, and specific goals with  the university center;  b) had confidence in the center’s competence and abilities as  well as its motives and fairness in sharing these abilities;";;"Consistent with hypothesis 1, we found that more mechanistic  firm structures are associated more with knowledge transfer  activities than with technology transfer activities. The t-test of  the difference between the two beta coefficients (i.e., 0.14 for  knowledge transfer activities compared to 0.04 for technology  transfer activities) was highly significant ( , 0.001).
The T-tests also indicate that flexible and change-oriented cul�tures are more related to technology transfer activities than  to knowledge transfer activities (0.25 versus 0.07, ,  0.05) supporting hypothesis 2(a). Table IV shows that stable  and direction-oriented cultures are more related to knowledge  transfer activities 0.48 than to technology transfer activi�ties 0.31 providing support for hypothesis 2(b) ( ,  0.05). In support of hypothesis 4, we found that more  customized university policies for IPR, patent ownership, and";;"Since I/U relationships involve both industrial firms and uni�versities, our primary focus on the industrial firm’s perspective
68 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT, VOL. 51, NO. 1, FEBRUARY 2004  limits the scope of our model. By concentrating on factors that  relate to both the firm and the university research center future  studies could expand upon our findings. Moving forward, re�searchers could examine a number of promising areas such as  the effect of university research center and industrial firm cul�tural compatibility, effective versus ineffective leadership in the  firm and university center, personality clashes between inter�acting individuals, and the existence or degree of shared goals.
Second, we looked at the behaviors and the processes  associated with knowledge transfer and technology transfer  rather than focusing on specific knowledge or technology  transfer outcomes. We assume that higher levels of certain  behaviors indicate that more technology and more knowledge  are being exchanged. Future studies should attempt to measure  outcomes of knowledge and technology transfer in addition to  the behaviors and processes associated with it.
Third, in collecting our survey questionnaire data, we were  fortunate to have senior-level managers from a large number  of firms in a wide cross-section of industries participate in the  study. Much of the data collected in this study were from single�source respondents who single-handedly described complex  organizational characteristics such as their firm’s structure and  culture. Collecting data from multiple respondents in each of  the firms could have enhanced the data’s richness. Additionally,  since the data for both the dependent and independent variables  were collected from the same person at the same time, common�method bias does exist. In examining the possible effect of this  bias, an additional analysis showed that the average inter-item  correlation among all the variables had a mean of 0.12 [47].
This positive result indicates a slight right-hand skew in the data";;Finally,  we must emphasize that this cross-sectional study has merely  provided a description of a complex phenomenon.

";;;;;;;The definition given by the UK Higher  Education Funding Council (HEFCE) is used to define USOs: new legal entities and  enterprises created by a Higher Education Institute or its staff to allow the commer�cialization of knowledge from academic research.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; The innovation ecosystem  concept is one which has innovation performance of an evolving set of actors,  activities, and artifacts, as well as their interrelationship as a central theme (Gran�strand and Holgersson 2019, 1). Although innovation ecosystems is a nonspatial  concept, in practice, it also has a geographical implication. Location offers various  possibilities for the ways that a set of actors, their activities, and their networks can  lead to the commercialization of their products and services ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; data analysis is presented to offer broad generalizations about  UK USOs. First, USOs’ characteristics are examined: years in operation, size, regions,  and the nature of the universities in which the firms originated. Next, selected relation�ships between USO/firm-level characteristics are demonstrated. The above analysis is  used to understand the current role of USOs in their respective region ;;;;;; The data set includes the following categories of variables: products  and/or services offered by years of operation, size, and sector;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; An estimation of ordinary least squares regression  shows a strong positive relationship between the number of institutions and the  number of USOs created (R2 ¼ .8). The correlation matrix also shows that there is a  relatively strong relationship between the number of staff and the number of USOs  created (Pearson’s r ¼ .59). This also suggests that the regional stock of univer�sities is a significant predictor of USOs (see Appendix). The analysis of variance3  confirmed the variation of the average spin-offs created across regions (i.e., F  value ¼ 25.46 greater than F crit. ¼ 4.844336). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In answer to the first question which asked how USOs are distributed and  characterized across different regions, the quantitative data show that the research�intensive universities produce the most USOs. Therefore, value creation (Adner and  Kapoor 2010) is directly associated with particular kinds of universities. For exam�ple, Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial College London, UCL from the Golden Triangle  region, and the University of Edinburgh (Scotland), respectively, are the leading  research institutions in the UK, and they are the top five universities that create high  volumes of spin-off firms. The role of research excellence in USO formation relates  to the study by Di Gregorio and Shane (2003), which argues that academics from  leading research universities may find it easier to assemble resources owing to their  ability to leverage the reputation of their institution and signal to the broader com�munity of their excellence (see also Van Looy et al. 2004). Additionally, university�based resources play an important role as exemplified by the positive correlation  between the number of full-time academic staff and the number of spin-off  Bagchi-Sen et al. 23
companies (see Lockett and Wright 2005). This highlights the different scale and  scope of knowledge production within innovation ecosystems within a region.
The evidence also shows the temporal pattern of USO development (e.g., firm  size and age; see Grandstrand and Holgersson 2019; Hite and Hesterly 2001; Lund�vall and Battese 2000; Ortin-Angel and Vendrell-Herrero 2014) across UK regions.
USOs in most UK regions are micro-, small-, or medium-sized firms that are still at  the early stages of their life cycle. The exceptions are the South East (Oxford,  Southampton) and Northern Ireland (Queen’s Belfast) regions which contain larger  USOs (250þ employees).";;"Several difficulties were encountered during the data collection process.
Employee numbers and the latest financial data for most of USO firms on public  web portals are incomplete. Additionally, approximately 14 percent of active com�panies did not have a public-facing website. Nevertheless, the data set of 844 firms  has a unique set of USOs across the UK. In the past, such data have been constructed  only for a particular region or university.

Skute 2017 - Mapping the field- a bibliometric analysis of the literature on university–industry collaborations;;;;;;;;;;;;"To address the challenges indicated above, we conduct a quantitative bibliometric  analysis of 435 peer-reviewed articles, using co-citation analysis and bibliographic cou�pling techniques. Up to now, quantitative review approaches in the context of U–I studies  are limited, especially when it comes to capturing the ffeld’s latest developments (for calls  resolving this gap, see e.g., Teixeira and Mota 2012; Meyer et al. 2014; Davey et al. 2016).
This limitation is surprising, as narrative reviews can include sampling, measurement,  stochastic, and external validity issues and generally do not allow to quantify the rela�tionships (Schmidt and Hunter 2004). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;university–industry collaborations;;;;;;;;;;University–industry ​ Bibliometrics ​ Co-citation analysis ​ Bibliographic  coupling ​ Academic entrepreneurship ​ Technology transfer ​ Knowledge  transfer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Cluster 6: Policy implications perspective (on university engagement)  Articles in this cluster analyse the management of U–I collaborations within different  institutional settings and the effects of such collaborations on the regional development.
This cluster is inter-linked with the ecosystem cluster (as a part of both co-citation analysis  and bibliographic coupling) with a higher focus on regional policy developments as a  potential catalyst or barrier for collaborative activities. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Thus, this review presents the immense contribution  that the analysis of U–I collaborations makes to various research streams. Building on  these ffndings and employing qualitative content analysis on the clustered publications, the  paper develops a research agenda that encourages future investigations of previously  overlooked features of U–I collaborations in general, and their role across levels of  analysis, contexts and stages of the collaboration process in particular.
";;Mapping the ffeld: a bibliometric analysis  of the literature on university–industry collaborations;;;;;;;;;; This paper employs co-citation  analysis and bibliographic coupling techniques to analyse the U–I publications dataset. The  ffndings indicate that the U–I collaborations research can be systematically clustered,  resulting in an interconnected ecosystem consisting of three levels: individual, organisa�tional and institutional, respectively. ;;;;;;;;;;;"This paper makes the following contributions: First, this study uncovers the evolution of  the U–I collaboration concept by comparing its foundations with current thematic areas  and emerging patterns. This paper consolidates the insights generated by U–I researchers in  the past years, thus providing a comprehensive reffection of the research ffeld. Second, by  performing a content analysis of identiffed thematic areas, this study advances a multi�layered and inter-connected research agenda encouraging future investigations of previ�ously understudied features and mechanisms of U–I collaborations on individual, organi�sational and institutional levels in general, and their role in various contexts and stages of  the collaboration process in particular.
";;;;;;;;;"The academic entrepreneurship perspective (Cluster 2) has a similar number of  publications to the distance and partner complementarity perspective; nevertheless, the  total and average numbers of citations indicate that it covers a smaller number of seminal  works that would shape the U–I research ffeld. However, compared to the ecosystem  (Cluster 3) and the interaction channels clusters (Cluster 4), the academic entrepreneurship  perspective (Cluster 2) appears to possess a slightly higher impact, as it is also the second  most recent cluster (13.81 years avg. existence).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Cluster 2: Academic entrepreneurship perspective  This cluster centres on the analysis of university evolution from traditionally research- and  education-oriented institutions towards the development of a multi-faceted system of  academic entrepreneurship. Following the Bayh–Dole Act, academic entrepreneurship has  received increasing attention from scholars and practitioners (Mowery et al. 2001).;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Cluster 1: Ecosystem perspective  A central tenet of this cluster is the interplay between university, industry and government  (i.e., Triple Helix). Largely, articles focus on explaining the impact of these three elements  on joint collaborative activities on regional and national levels, including the economic and  societal impact, as well as on innovation outcomes. In addition, articles belonging to this  cluster also examine the dynamics of Triple Helix infrastructure (Kwon et al. 2012; Lei  et al. 2012). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Cluster 4: Interaction channels perspective  Research belonging to this cluster focuses on the variety of interaction channels between  the involved parties of U–I partnerships and the associated determinants. The central  element of this cluster is the identiffcation and characterisation of distinct interaction  channels and knowledge transfer mechanisms, ranging from scientiffc publications and  published reports, public conferences and meetings, licencing and patenting and to contract  research and consultancy (Cohen et al. 2002; Wright et al. 2008)";;;;; Cluster 2: Social relations perspective  The largest cluster in terms of included articles focuses on the social aspect of U–I  collaborations and knowledge transfer. The social relations perspective cluster corresponds  to the social component of the interaction channels cluster (as part of co-citation analysis  results), focusing on the effectiveness of interaction and communication among the part�ners. ;;;;;;Cluster 3: Ecosystem perspective  With the increasing recognition of U–I collaborations as a catalyst for regional and national  economic development, the interaction between university, industry and government has  attracted notable interest in research (Park et al. 2005). This cluster addresses the roles of  the actors embedded in this ecosystem and the sub-dynamics of economic exchange,  scientiffc and technological innovation, and institutional control within the Triple Helix  model (Leydesdorff and Fritsch 2006). ;"Cluster 1: Distance and partner complementarity perspective  Research belonging to this cluster is focused on understanding the impact of U–I partner  distance and partner complementarity on their potential to foster innovation and regional  economic development by means of joint scientiffc and technological advancements.
Speciffcally, this cluster explores the role of partner capabilities critical to efffciently  acquire, assimilate, transform and effectively exploit knowledge and resources shared and  generated within U–I and other R&D collaborations (Cohen and Levinthal 1989; Zahra and  George 2002). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"While three themes are overlapping with the ffndings of the co�citation analysis, namely the ecosystem perspective (cluster 1), academic entrepreneurship  perspective (cluster 3), and distance perspective (cluster 4), we uncovered three additional  inter-related themes: the social relations perspective (cluster 2) addressing the relationship  development among individuals and ffrms, interaction process and knowledge transfer  perspective outlining the dynamics and key elements of the U–I collaborations, and policy  implications perspective (cluster 6) highlighting the impact of regional policy  developments.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Cluster 5: Interaction process and knowledge transfer perspective  This cluster takes a dynamic view of U–I collaborations, identifying and exploring success  factors and barriers of the collaboration process, both from academic and industrial per�spectives. Speciffcally, the interaction process and knowledge transfer perspective  explores different types of U–I interaction channels and their effectiveness in terms of  achieving short-term or long-term goals (De Fuentes and Dutrenit 2012).;;;;"The second sub-stream addresses the role of technology transfer offfce (TTO) as a  mechanism to successfully commercialise research results, and their related role in inter�action channels as a facilitator of knowledge and technology transfer between the U–I  collaboration partners (Bozeman 2000; Thursby and Thursby 2002). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Within the ecosystem perspective, by developing  contractual agreements with industry partners to conduct research in particular areas and  exploit the economic potential, university representatives exercise some of the functions of  research administrators in private business (Etzkowitz 1984). ;;;;;"Additionally, by conducting a qualitative content analysis, based on  the identiffed articles, we generate nuanced insights into relevant future research directions.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The ffndings of our bibliometric study suggest that the U–I  collaborations research can be seen as a multi-layered ecosystem consisting of intercon�nected perspectives on individual, organisational and institutional levels. Our study con�cludes by offering a nuanced research agenda with valuable implications for academics and  policy makers.
";;nevitably, this study also has certain limitations paving the way for several extensions of  the bibliometric analysis of U–I collaboration research and additional analyses. First, this;;"Conversely, it would be interesting to examine how U–I  collaborations affect policy development, requiring approaches that are multi-disciplinary  and historical in nature. In relation to the incentives that could stimulate engagement in U–  I collaborative projects on the part of academics, research should consider that collabo�ration with industry does not necessarily foster success in academia. As indicated by Lee  and Miozzo (2015), the engagement in industry-involved projects by physicists and  engineering Ph.D. researchers is negatively related to their career in academia. It is  therefore not only up to the university but the entire science system including policy  makers to come up with an incentive scheme specifying how and when academics can be  promoted if they engage in the third mission of the university. This issue need to be further  explored by research, outlining the characteristics and conditions of best practices.

Skute 2018 - Opening the black box of academic entrepreneurship;;;;;;;;;;;;"While I note the availability of other databases, I follow the methodological   approach of previous research (e.g., see Meyer et al. 2014); since this study is designed to   primarily examine the patterns of indicators, I accept this limitation. To construct the dataset, I   designed the following search query: “academic entrepreneurship” OR “academi* spin*” OR  “universit* spin*” OR “academi* commerciali*ation” OR “universit* commerciali*ation” OR  “entrepren* universit*” OR “entrepren* academi*”.

This analysis type, which has   been acknowledged in the past years, enables one to perform a comprehensive assessment   of the state-of-the-art literature in a particular research feld (Kovács et al. 2015; Meyer   et  al. 2014; Teixeira and Mota 2012). Further, I build on the results of bibliographic   coupling, introducing both quantitative and qualitative eforts to extend the research ";;This paper makes the following contributions: First, by employing both quantitative   and qualitative methods, I contribute systematic insights to the evolution of the academic   entrepreneurship feld.;;;;;;;;;;;;;Opening the black box of academic entrepreneurship:   a bibliometric analysis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The bibliographic coupling’s results indicate that the academic entrepreneurship   research feld is based on four interconnected clusters: (1) the anatomy of an entrepreneur�ial university and its main components, (2) university spinofs and technology commerciali�zation, (3) the identities of academic entrepreneurs and their motivations and barriers in   entrepreneurial activities, and (4) knowledge transfer and regional economic impacts.
";;;;;;;"Leveraging competency has already been discussed. In the context of examining aca�demic entrepreneurs’ identities, opportunity refnement competency and championing   competency are interesting to study in depth. Opportunity refnement competency gen�erally refers to the ability to discover opportunities based on scientifc research results,   and to further develop these into viable business concepts. Championing competency  refers to the ability to identify with a venture and to persuade others to contribute to its   development. These two entrepreneurial competencies are crucial for successful aca�demic entrepreneurs.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The importance of academic entrepreneurship has been widely recognized in the lit�erature, evidenced by the notable increase of relevant publications in the past years (Bock   et al. 2017; Bozeman et al. 2013; Czarnitzki et al. 2014; Gümüsay and Bohné 2018; Skute   et al. 2017; Zavale and Langa 2018). Prior research signals the potential to better under�stand this phenomenon at the individual, organizational, and institutional levels (Hayter   et al. 2018; Rothaermel et al. 2007). ";;;"Also, an academic entrepreneur’s environment shapes their extent of engagement in   entrepreneurial activities and their preferred channels of engagement (Bercovitz and   Feldman 2008; D’Este and Perkmann 2011; Perkmann et  al. 2013). Academic entrepre�neurs tend to more actively engage in entrepreneurial activities if the parent institution   sufciently supports possibilities and has developed norms that stimulate such activities. 
A connected research focus in this cluster is the roles of business incubators and science   parks regarding facilitating the development of academic entrepreneurs, both among expe�rienced researchers and young academics or even students.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" The knowledge transfer and regional economic impacts   cluster (Cluster 4) has expanded signifcantly and is still actively developing. While the   entrepreneurial university cluster (Cluster 1) experienced a strong increase between 2014   and 2015, it has leveled of in the past 2 years. A similar pattern, but with smaller num�bers of related publications, can be associated with Cluster 2, which focuses on USOs and   technological commercialization. The research into entrepreneurial identities has remained   fairly stable, with some negative developments in the past 2 years.
";;;;;;;;;;The bibliographic coupling’s results are illustrated in Fig. 7. The visualized bibliometric   network includes four interconnected clusters with unique labels based on the shared refer�ences and their patterns. To identify all themes and emerging topics in this research feld,   I applied no restrictions concerning the number of citations necessary to be included in ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"I constructed and visualized thematic clusters based on normalized relatedness measures. 
I deemed an association strength measure appropriate for normalizing co-occurrence data,   in accordance with the methodological approach of previous studies (Van Eck and Waltman   2009, 2010). Detailed methodological overviews, including calculations of the association   strength measure and comparisons to other well-known measures, are provided in Van Eck   and Waltman (2009) and Waltman et al. (2010). I constructed clustered bibliometric networks   by adopting the visualization of similarities (VOS) approach, using an optimized algorithm of   VOSviewer 1.6.5 (Van Eck and Waltman 2007, 2010).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The fndings of this paper indicate that the academic entrepreneurship research feld can   be analyzed from the perspective of four interconnected elements: (1) the entrepreneurial   university, (2) USOs, (3) academic entrepreneurs, and (4) the entrepreneurial environment   in which all these elements are embedded in order to transfer the knowledge and tech�nologies developed at the parent university, as well as to commercialize the research out�comes to stimulate regional economic and societal development. Specifcally, the biblio�metric literature analysis results indicate that this research domain can be linked within the   academic entrepreneurship ecosystem. The results are in line with previous research, and   indicate that academic entrepreneurship is a dynamic, multilayered ecosystem with actors   at the individual, organizational, and institutional levels (Audretsch et al. 2019; Guerrero   and Urbano 2012; Harrison and Leitch 2010; Hayter et al. 2018; Miranda et al. 2018; Perk�mann et al. 2013).
";;;"While this bibliometric literature analysis has presented a list of important fndings, it has   limitations, which provide future development areas. First, I have covered a broad scope of   academic entrepreneurship literature based on a specifc search query that enabled me to   highlight key elements of this research feld. However, including additional keywords in   a search query could lead to the development of a more comprehensive dataset and, thus,   to additional empirical insights. Second, the constructed dataset had a scope of 10 years. 
Experimenting with additional time periods can lead to the identifcation of additional arti�cles, especially potentially seminal work on academic entrepreneurship, and can therefore   present additional perspectives. Similarly, since the main goal was to build on the litera�ture to identify current themes and emerging trends, bibliometric analysis is restricted to   the bibliographic coupling technique. Thus, extending results with co-citation analysis,   co-occurrence analysis, and other quantitative literature review methods can provide addi�tional insights and key elements on the path to developing a comprehensive understand�ing of the academic entrepreneurship ecosystem. Finally, further research can signifcantly   beneft from application of advanced computational methods. For instance, topic model�ling and other unsupervised machine learning methods can improve the scope and level of   bibliometric analysis in future studies.

As with any empirical re�search, it has contextual conditions that must be considered. Firstly, we  used ffrms with at least one innovation activity in the last three years,  excluding those without a signiffcant innovation reported in that  period. Although this was necessary to work with a sample of in�novators whose innovation strategies, either ambidextrous or specia�lized, could be compared, generalization of the results must consider  that non-innovators are excluded from our sample. Secondly, we used a  sample of manufacturers, which means that the ffndings do not ne�cessarily apply to other ffrms, like services companies. In their meta�analysis, Junni et al. (2013) found that, for manufacturers, exploitation  has a greater effect on performance than exploration, whereas for ser�vice ffrms, exploration outperformed exploitation. This calls for an  extension of our research to compare ambidexterity and specialization  to services ffrms.

";;;;;;;Governance and performance in co-exploitation  projects  Co-exploitation projects are innovation projects carried out in  collaboration with other organizations to expand the existing  knowledge. Their main characteristics are their applicability or  immediacy (e.g. positioning a product on the market), their  facility to adopt routines (i.e. planning and organizing) and  their purpose of reffning and extending existing knowledge  (Arranz and Arroyabe, 2012). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Inter-organizational governance and performance  The development of innovation initiatives requires, most of the  time, the integration of specialized knowledge and abilities from  external organizations (Bercovitz and Feldman, 2007).

Our results for co-exploration projects  might be interpreted in terms of the trade-off between ffexibility  and the need for safeguarding. Those needing more ffexibility  might obtain better performance with a predominant use of  informal governance, while when safeguarding is the main  concern, contractual governance is more effective. ;".

• What has been found in empirical research with respect to doctoral students’ interaction  experience and outcomes of student-industry interaction?
";;;;;;;"Doctoral students are also seen as important for formation and maintenance of network ties  between ffrms and universities, whilst they are students and after they graduate (Lam 2001;  Slaughter et al. 2002). The role of doctoral students in network formation focus on the  social ties that exist between students and their supervisors, and how such established  relations are central when forming new links (Liebeskind et al. 1996; Powell et al. 1996).
";;"Since doctoral students are important as researchers in  universities; changes at the level of doctoral student research have consequences for the";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"overall production of scientiffc knowledge in universities. Training of doctoral students is  also a process of reproduction of academic environments, and changes in doctoral edu�cation are related to changes in modes of academic knowledge production (Enders 2002).
Academic research is increasingly carried out in a context of application (Gibbons et al.
1994) and collaboratively by networks consisting of university, ffrm and government  representatives (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000). Such changes have been accompanied  by institutional changes in the universities, and in the policy and funding system of  academic research, emphasizing collaboration across disciplines and across sectors. Doing  research in such a context requires a range of competences in addition to academic  excellence. ";;;;;;;;" In the literature, three roles are  attributed to graduate students in university–industry relations: graduate students are  central for the production of knowledge, for transfer of knowledge, and for the formation  and maintenance of network ties between universities and ffrms.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Another role attributed to doctoral students is that they serve as channels of knowledge  transfer between universities and ffrms whilst they are students, and particularly after they  graduate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Research indicates that doctoral student—ffrm collaboration is a heterogeneous phenom�enon and that doctoral students’ collaboration experiences vary accordingly. ;;;;"Further research should attempt to gain information about different contexts of col�laborations that doctoral students are involved in by sampling more varied collaborative  arrangements. More longitudinal research is also needed, as present research largely focus  on the initial transition from university to work, and not on career trajectories as they  develop over time. One approach that will give a broader spectrum of experiences as well  as more information of long term effects of doctoral student—industry interaction is  research that follows collaborative projects over time. Collecting longitudinal data by  following concrete R&D collaboration projects over time will provide further knowledge  about initiation of collaborations, and also about coordination of R&D collaboration, and  about how knowledge is created and exchanged in UI collaborations, and how doctoral  students are involved in these exchanges.

The ceiling to coproduction in university industry research collaboration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Engaged scholarship;  knowledge coproduction;  knowledge production  strategy; research activities;  university–industry research  collaboration";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This paper has proposed academic and industry project leader outlooks on knowledge  as an explanatory factor for the non-occurrence of coproduction in university–industry  research collaborations. However, it should be recognised that there are other factors  which explain the degree of engagement in research activities, including disciplinary vari�ation (Cherney, Head, Boreham, Povey, & Ferguson, 2012; Jacobson, Butterill, & Goering,  2004), the nature of the research problem and the stage of the research process (Ross,  Lavis, Rodrigues, Woodside, & Denis, 2003).
";;;;"This paper has implications for understanding academic and industry partner relation�ships, the practical management of university–industry research collaborations and the  development of better strategies to encourage engaged scholarship. The paper demon�strated academic and industry partner engagement in university–industry research collab�orations is a complex relationship that is determined in part by preconceived beliefs that  academics and industry partners bring to the projects. The analysis suggests that project  roles may be deffned prior to academic and industry partners entering university–industry  research collaborations, for example because of preconceived beliefs which, unchallenged,  appear to result in the passive engagement of industry partners in research activities. These  complex social relationships need to be considered in the design of initiatives that aim to  encourage university–industry research collaborations. Further exploration into how aca�demics and industry are predisposed to act in university–industry research collaborations,  and why the broader society views academic knowledge as superior in the context of uni�versity–industry research collaborations, would help to understand the ceiling to the  coproduction of knowledge.

Todd Davey (2020) - Understanding entrepreneurial academics;Understanding entrepreneurial  academics - how they perceive  their environment differently;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Drawing on a large data set of 10,836 responses across 33 countries, the  empirical study investigates European academics who undertake four academic entrepreneurship activities  (spin-out creation, commercialisation of R&D results, joint R&D and consulting) to determine if they perceive  the environment for academic entrepreneurship differently than those who undertake only some of the  activities and those undertaking none at all.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; University-industry, Knowledge transfer, Entrepreneurial academic, Academic entrepreneur,  Entrepreneurial university, Spin-offs;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"To support aE development, universities are adopting strategies (Siegel and Wright, 2015)  that support and encourage all university stakeholders specially, academics to have  entrepreneurial behaviour (Ambos et al., 2008; Loi and Di Guardo, 2015). While some  strategies are related to the official recognition of importance of aE, such as UBC’s integration  in the vision and mission of the university (Clarysse et al., 2005), other strategies are focussed  on the implementation, such as the dedication of resources for the UBC (Phan and Siegel,  2006) and incentives, which has been a well-recognised mechanism to support and enhance  the UBC (Siegel and Wright, 2015; Lam, 2011).
";;;;;;;;"However, the narrow view of aE excludes many  activities undertaken by an academic in which academics apply their entrepreneurial skills  and therefore, exclude many academics who undertake them.
A broader understanding of aE can originally be found in studies provided by Klofsten  and Jones-Evans (2000) suggesting that academic entrepreneurship is “all commercialisation  activities outside the normal university duties of basic research and teaching” (Klofsten and  Jones-Evans, 2000, p. 299). A number of studies by Tartari et al. (2012); Benneworth and  Jongbloed (2010) and D’Este and Perkmann (2011) also frame aE in this way.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;entrepreneurial  academics ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Although most authors consider academic entrepreneurs to be those who create spin-offs,  patent or license their research results and (Ljungberg, 2011) more recently, other activities  have also been included. ;"Nevertheless, two primary views can be discerned (G€oktepe-Hulten and Mahagaonkar,  2010), a narrow and a broad conceptualisation of aE. The “narrow” view is mainly defined  from an economic standpoint and equates academic entrepreneurship with the creation of  new ventures, often referred to as academic spin-offs (Autio, 1997; Cooper, 1971; Shane, 2004;  Wright et al., 2007; Shane et al., 2015) and commercial applications through the development  of patents, licences and spin-offs (Czarnitzki et al., 2016; Shane et al., 2015). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; the study empirically explores how entrepreneurial academics perceive  external factors, such as barriers, motivators and organisational commitment to aE. ;;;;;;;;;;;This paper investigates the question: how do academics with different levels of commitment  to aE perceive the environment for aE?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Motivations propelling aE refer to  research outcomes including application of research into practice (Franco and Haase, 2015)  and new insights for research (Qian, 2018; Van der Sijde, 2012).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"A survey on the entrepreneurial activities of  academics was designed as an online survey, piloted with 40 academics in three countries and  translated into 24 languages. The survey was sent to three managers in each of the over 3,500  registered higher educational institutions (HEIs) in the European Economic Area using a  random sampling method. These managers were requested to further distribute the online  survey to all academics within their institutions who were the target group for this paper. A  total of 10,836 academics from 851 institutions, 24% of all HEIs who received the survey, in 33  countries responded. A weighting system was created to adjust the responses to the number  of academics per country in order to ensure a representative sample by the country.
Academics were asked whether and to what extent they undertake four entrepreneurial  activities: (1) spin-off creation, (2) commercialisation of R&D results (3) joint R&D with  industry and (4) consulting. Academics were also asked how much certain factors motivate  them to, or prevent them from undertaking those entrepreneurial activities. In addition,  academics evaluated the development of a series of supporting mechanisms in their  institutions. The four responses were measured on ten-point Likert scales (1 5 not at all,  10 5 to a very high extent).
A series of analyses were undertaken using IBM SPSS, 26. First, a set of frequencies show  how often academics undertake each of the activities or a combination of them";;;;;;;;;;In determining how academics will respond to barriers, the work of Tartari et al. (2012)  found that some barriers (Mertonian) pertaining to cultural differences are overcome through  the act of undertaking aE activities, whilst other (transactional) barriers tend to be less  influenced by having engagement experience. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The findings show that less than 1% of academics undertake exclusively spin-offs creation or  R&D commercialisation; however, the majority also engage in other entrepreneurial activities such as joint  R&D and consulting and even other education and management engagement activities with industry. In  addition, entrepreneurial academics in Europe perceive significantly higher motivators and more developed  supporting mechanisms for academic entrepreneurship. However, their perceptions of barriers are similar.
";;"The paper has a number of limitations. First, there is not a common understanding of  academic entrepreneurship and thus, two clear definitions were provided. There is also a  possibility that the sample suffers some self-selection bias, particularly of academics more  inclined to engage in aE. Moreover, whilst we provided some clear objective differentiation  between academics undertaking all, some and no aE activities, the assessment of barriers,  drivers, the development of supporting mechanisms and their individual extent aE activities  are subjective assessments sensitive to academics’ own perceptions. Furthermore, this study  establishes relationships but not causality related to the environment effect on the academic’s  extent of engagement in aE which will require further analyses.
";;"Whilst this research has established the perceived differences of entrepreneurial academic  versus those partly or not engaged in aE, it has not conclusively identified the factors that  influence aE. Determining these factors is the subject of further research. Further research  should also seek to identify for which institutions is worthwhile pursuing spin-offs and  commercialisation of research and a deeper study of the mechanisms supporting academic  entrepreneurship or entrepreneurial academics would be highly valuable. This same study  could be replicated in new countries to see if results hold.

Trequattrini 2015 - The Impact of Entrepreneurial Universities on Regional Growth;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The research is based on a qualitative and quantitative method (Anderson et al. 2012;  Myers 2013; Waters 2008). In order to assess the relationship between entrepreneurial  universities and the regional development, it is utilized a multi-method approach with  an empirical analysis.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Entrepreneurial universities. Regional economic growth . Local intellectual  capital . Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In this perspective, the regional innovation systems approach (Cooke et al. 2000,  2004) has provided a new way of conceiving innovation as an evolutionary, non-linear  and interactive process, requiring lots of communication and collaboration among  companies and research organizations. Entrepreneurial universities are regional inno�vation intermediaries (Nauwelaers 2011) with the function of creating suitable condi�tions in which to develop an entrepreneurial mindset.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"local intellectual capital (Stewart 1997), composed by:  & local human capital, the set of competences existing in the region;  & local relational capital, that depends on the quality of relationships and interactions  between actors creating local economic growth;  & local structural capital, corresponding to the values, traditions and culture embed�ded in the region.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This research carried out an empirical investigation on Italian public universities  considering separately the Italian regions and regional economic variables. Starting  from the concept of learning region and using findings of the research, the final aim of  the study was to introduce the concept of local intellectual capital and, in this perspec�tive, to appreciate the function of entrepreneurial universities in fostering and enhanc�ing the intangible resources of a territory.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the relationship between the entre�preneurial universities activities and the local economic growth through an empirical  analysis.;;;;;;;;;;;"It follows that the research questions are:  RQ1: Which is the impact of entrepreneurial culture on regional development?
RQ2: Do entrepreneurial universities represent a key actor within a specific  enabling environment to foster local growth?
";;;;;;;"The neo-Shumpeterian perspective underlines the fact that innovation involves the  commercialization of new knowledge which is what differentiates it from invention  (Arthur 2009).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"According to a traditional setting, innovation is considered at basis of regional growth. A  modern implementation of Shumpeter’s proposal has to take into account his theoretical  movement from individual entrepreneurship to innovative oligopolistic competition as  the main driver of economic evolution (Schumpeter 2000; Andersen 2011).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" the regional innovation systems approach (Cooke et al. 2000,  2004) has provided a new way of conceiving innovation as an evolutionary, non-linear  and interactive process, requiring lots of communication and collaboration among  companies and research organizations which generates a collective learning process.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The Jacobian tradition similarly sees knowledge transfer as an important input to  local growth although its source is somewhat different, emanating from outside the  local production environment and grounded and diversified economic activity rather  than scale and concentrated production (Jacobs 1969).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"An entrepreneurial university could be seen as a natural incubator that provides  support, structures and knowledge for students willing to be entrepreneurs (Etzkowitz  2003; Guerrero and Urbano 2012).
";;;;;;;;"In  particular, the triple helix metaphor has especially been applied at the regional level  (Etzkowitz 2003). A dynamic innovation system emphasizes the interaction of univer�sities with other local actors for the favourable development of innovation (Etzkowitz  and Leydesdorff 2000).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;"The theoretical framework (Fig. 1) starts considering innovation processes at the  heart of inception of new firms and development of existing ones.
In this context, entrepreneurial universities play a key role to create an entrepre�neurial culture (Fig. 2) through three-pillar activities.
Each pillar has been investigated through a multi-linear correlation in order to  measure the impact on specific economic variables:";;;"The assessment is made through a dummy variable:  – regions where at least one university activated an entrepreneurial curriculum have  been assessed with the value 1;  – regions where all public universities considered have not activated entrepreneurial  curricula have been assessed with the value 0.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Where Yi is an indicator of regional (i) economic growth and for each university:;;;;;" bx represents the existence of entrepreneurial curricula;  & cm corresponds to the number of academic spin-offs divided by number of  researchers;  & dz represents the ratio between the amount of the item private grants and contracts  and the number of researchers.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"These results can be explained starting from the concept of learning region.
In a learning region the most important intangible resources are represented by the  local intellectual capital (Stewart 1997), composed by:  & local human capital, the set of competences existing in the region;  & local relational capital, that depends on the quality of relationships and interactions  between actors creating local economic growth;  & local structural capital, corresponding to the values, traditions and culture embed�ded in the region.
";;"The research presents some limits because it concerns only Italian regions; for this  reason, there is a need to expand the dataset in order to broaden the empirical analysis  to other geographical region. Moreover, indicators of regional economic growth do not  take into account other important variables such as patents and other activities related to  knowledge diffusion.
";;Future studies will be conducted to validate the results of this study demonstrating  the relevance of entrepreneurial universities for the local economic growth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is a tool that integrates  with business model canvas and then both of them provide a detailed plan of how to  create and sustain value into the organisation and deliver it to the customer.

Litera�ture review has been favourable to test the hypothesis of the specific papers, ensuring  representable data of U-I collaborations, the correlation of knowledge management and  the value proposition of the University.
Qualitative,";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; The purpose of this  paper is the analysis of U-I cooperation– especially under the new online  requirements – an illustration of how the knowledge is created and shared in the  organisation based on the socialisation, externalisation, combination, and  internalisation (SECI) model and how this is aligned to the value proposition. ;;;;;;;;;;;"The hypothesis formulated in order to answer the following research questions:   How the University can capture and diffuse effectively this knowledge in its  environment.
 Why knowledge creation and diffusion are important for potential cooperation with  the Industry.
 Why and how IT can reinforce knowledge creation and transfer (via an online  learning environment).
";;;;;;;Knowledge transfer is an internal process which is been implemented within the en�vironment of the organisation. As a result, every external knowledge that is new to the  organisation require competencies that will ensure the acquisition, storage and re-use  of the new knowledge (Gilbert & Cordey-Hayes, 1996). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The value proposition of the university is based on knowledge creation and diffusion.
While the size of the company should be taken into account when evaluating the needs  of the industrial partner, new knowledge is a common feature that exists in the agenda  of every company (Osterwalder, 2010). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Collaboration types and practices between University-Industry (U-I) have been in�creased since the 1980s. It has been mentioned that these partnerships started to focus  on pure exchange of knowledge, co-invention of patents and R&D projects (Levy, Roux,  & Wolff, 2007). From the perspective of the industry, this collaboration is considered  to be as a very important link that is directly connected with consultancy and joint re�search (Cohen, Nelson, & Walsh, 2002) based on fundamental dimensions for success�ful collaborative relationships (Schiuma & Carlucci, 2018).;According to Nonaka and Konno (1998), knowledge is categorised into tacit and ex�plicit.;;Knowledge transfer differs from other types of transactions because it depends on an  equal exchange so both participants benefit approximately with the same way. It is con�sidered, like knowledge management, as an internal process which is based on the  process of knowledge by using skills inside the organisation that will contribute posi�tively and increase the overall outcome quality (Amesse & Cohendet, 2001). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Yusuf (2008) stresses that commercialisation and knowledge sharing is crucial  when the knowledge is either uncodified or tacit. Restrictions on open knowledge shar�ing do have a negative impact in innovation, business creation, and eventually confront�ing societal challenges;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This iterative process is continuously creating, re-use and diffuse the knowledge  in the organisation increasing its value. University and Industry have different motives  that enable them to develop this collaboration (Dang, Jasovska, Gulzar Rammal, &  Schlenker, 2019; Robertson, McCarthy, & Pitt, 2019; Thomas & Paul, 2019).
";;;;;;;;;"Hadăr, Marin, Costoiu, Boanță, and Cișmașu (2016) and Nielsen and Sort (2013) have  used the Business Model Canvas to analyse the collaboration of the University-Industry  and how the value is created and supported (Fig. 2).
";;;;;;The design of databases is a three-step process: The conceptual, logical and physical  design part. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Customer relationships  The particular block demonstrates the structure of the relationship the organisation  has with its customer. From the university’s perspective, an Industrial partner can be  taken into account as a customer because it is usually funding the research that the  University conducts in order to apply its knowledge. ;"Customer segments  Customer segments block refers to the customers that the organisation is interested in.
The University has to analyse their interests, compare them with the needs of the po�tential customer and finally establish a cooperation that will benefit both the university  and the customer. ";;;;;;;;Key resources  Key resources refer to the assets that an organisation must obtain in order to develop  its business model. Financial resources are crucial because they support the operation  and the research that is conducted in the university. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"A limitation to this paper is that is based on the use of IT as a technical infrastruc�ture of the collaboration between U-I without taking into consideration the perceptions  of the individuals in the organisation regarding the use of the database. Furthermore,  the SECI Model is based on Japanese organisations, where the employers have built  strong relationships due to the larger amount of time spending together in contrast to  the university’s employees – which spend more time working distantly and in an online  environment – and as a result, the most difficult part of the SECI model, the socialisa�tion process, is effectively developed. A question worth answering is in what extend the  IT is affecting the knowledge sharing process in the university and how these factors  that enhance (or slowing down) the process can effectively be identified and measured.

Valentina De Marchi (2019) - Who benefits from university-industry collaboration for environmental sustainability;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The study is explorative in nature, based on an original   dataset of more than 350 university-industry (U-I) research and consultancy contracts signed   by more than 70 professors specializing in environmental sustainability-related academic   disciplines at the University of Padova (Italy) for the period 2008–2012. Social network   analysis was used to map the professor-partner network. Regression analyses to verify the   impact of collaboration on performance took account of contract characteristics, subject   characteristics and partner characteristics. Interviews with key informants at UNIPD were   used to complement and validate the emerging evidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;academic engagement, university-industry collaboration, knowledge transfer,   performance, social network analysis, sustainability;;;;university-industry collaboration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" The paper analyses the characteristics and performance of university-industry   collaboration for knowledge transfer in relation to environmental sustainability.
";;;;;;;;;;;"H1: U-I collaboration (in the form of academic engagement) targeting environmental innovation is   positively associated with university performance (measured as professors’ scientific productivity).
";;;;;;;;;;the specific focus adopted in this study   refers to the academic engagement (Perkmann et al., 2013), that is formal agreements between   the industry (firm) and the university considered at the personal (professor) as well as   organizational (department) levels – formal targeted and non-targeted agreements (Ankrah   and Al-tabbaa, 2015). With respect to formal U-I agreementrelated to licencing patents toward   the firms (IPR-related activities) as well as academic entrepreneurship (spin-off), the academic   engagement is more related to knowledge development and knowledge transfer rooted into   U-I collaboration (Perkmann et al., 2013). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; While these terms are often used interchangeably, responsible and sustainable   innovation refers essentially to consideration of social and environmental impacts of business   activities in relation to its products and processes, also within a value chain perspective;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Granted that this is a conservative approach to identifying sustainability-related research, this   proxy was adopted because, for privacy reasons, it was not possible to access a detailed   description of each project. Based on this criterion, 349 green contracts were identified,  representing 14% of the total sample and involving 71 professors and 199 external partners.
The 349 selected projects had a combined value of 10,205,750 Euro.
A comparison of green and non-green contracts showed that the two categories did not differ  significantly in terms of contract duration; in both cases, almost 70% of the contracts were for   a period of 1 year. The two categories were also similar in terms of the geography of the project   partners; in both cases, 60% of the contracts involved partners located in the same region as   the University, although non-green contracts proved slightly more likely to engage with   foreign partners (6.8% as compared to 4.9% for green contracts). It can therefore be assumed  that no bias was caused by the exclusion of non-green contracts from the analysis.
The second database included the publication records of the professors who led the research   contracts identified in the first database. Referring to the public website ‘Padua Research   Archive’, which lists all publications by UNIPD professors, the authors collected information   regarding the number of publications for each of the professors involved.
6  The third dataset contains the financial information on firms involved in the contracts, before   and after the contract was signed and is using data from the data source AIDA Bureau Van   Dijk, where balance sheets of limited liability Italian companies are included. Table 1 reports   and describe all the variables included in the analysis.
In order to get a more in-depth understanding of our research objective, interviews were   conducted with key informants from UNIPD departments working on sustainability-related   issues, including those two hosting the majority of professors included in the whole dataset   and the sub-sample of collaborations focusing on green contracts only.";;;;;;;;;;In this   respect, firms can strengthen their competitive advantage by relying on new knowledge   connected to the way firm can proactively approach (and solve) environmental issues, also  enhancing their internal resources (Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" By focusing in particular   on the contracts signed by professors with companies in the realm of environmental   sustainability, these results suggest a possible trade-off between engaging in U-I   collaborations and publishing—that is, the more a professor engages with companies, the   greater the diminution in their ability to publish. These findings should provide food for   thought when evaluating professors’ careers: the greater a university’s interest in impacting   more widely on (local) society (Cooke, 2010), the more it should consider how best to   compensate for lower publishing scores by complementing traditional (publication)  indicators with other performance indicators. In times of a greater importance of universities’   third mission, the traditional focus on scientific publications might be challenged. At the same   time, university administrations and governing bodies can learn that the research transfer   comes at a prize, i.e. the opportunity costs of researchers involved in U-I collaborations in   terms of a decrease in scientific publications (at least in the first three years after the start of   the collaboration). The descriptive analysis showed that the range of U-I collaborations for   environmental sustainability can be quite broad and spread over different faculties and   departments. If this approach is beneficial for both professors and companies involved in U-I   collaborations remains an open question. 
";;"At the same time, limitations of our research need to be addressed. The first limitation is our   focus on the number of publications published in the three years after the contract was signed   as the dependent variable on the university side of the collaborations and the variation in   average turnover on the industry side. Both dependent variables are first indicators for the   impact on both sides, but more research is needed to fully assess the non-economic impact of   such collaborations—in other words, the social and environmental benefits that can be  achieved at both firm and societal level as a result of U-I collaboration. This extension will be 
necessary to account for the actual impacts of sustainability-related research transfer through   collaborations. The second limitation is our focus on one form of U-I collaborations only. Due   to a lack of publicly available information, the analysis was built on the specific data set from   UNIPD. It would also be of value to examine more extensively the content of such contracts   in order to distinguish the differing forms of collaboration (e.g. consultancy-oriented vs basic  research-oriented) for a fuller understanding of the impact of these relationships on both firms   and professors. Third, our analysis did focus on one university only. The scale and scope of   U-I collaborations may differ quite extensively in other universities, especially when there is   a more formal strategic focus on environmental sustainability as part of the university’s third   mission. The same holds true for the regulatory environment of the firms involved in these U�I collaborations. In case of tax reliefs or other financial incentives, the results might differ in   other settings as well. Forth, a proxy to classify which project could be defined as sustainable  has been used, which did not allow us to verify if and which innovation have been developed   following the knowledge transfer from the University.";;Further research should be conducted to assess the extent to which the results from this   preliminary analysis can be generalised to other contexts—that is, to other universities and   other countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We  start with the general question whether division  members publish more or less than their colleagues  who are non-division members. In a second part of  the analysis, we try to map possible effects on the  academics’ research agenda by investigating whether  or not the nature of the publications differs between  division members and non-division members (always  use the terminology division versus non-division  members; this is more accurate since they are all fac�ulty members anyway). ";;" We examine whether entrepreneurial and scientiffc performance in academia can be reconciled. Our empirical  ffndings (KU Leuven, Belgium) suggest that both activities do not hamper each other; engagement in entrepreneurial activities  coincides with increased publication outputs, without affecting the nature of the publications involved. ";;;;;;;;;;;" The following research questions hence are cen�tral to the empirical part.
1. Do faculty members, who are systematically in�volved in contract research with industry, publish  more or less than their colleagues in comparable  research areas and faculties who are not engaged  in such systematic endeavors?
2. Do faculty members, who are systematically in�volved in contract research with industry, have dif�ferent publication proffles (applied versus basic)  than their faculty colleagues?
3. Is there a shift over time in the differential publi�cation proffles observed?

";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"university–industry interac�tion emerged in the 1990s. They were based on the  concepts of scientiffc networks (Steinmueller, 1994;  Pavitt, 1997; David et al., 1997), strategy, structural  analysis of industries and competitors (Porter, 1995),  and a new vision on industry, academia and gov�ernment interactions as encompassed by the ‘Triple  Helix’ model (Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz, 1996,  1998; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 1997, 1998, 2000).
Closely associated with the Triple Helix model, the  notion of ‘entrepreneurial universities’ (Etzkowitz,  1990; Branscomb et al., 1999; Etzkowitz et al., 1998)  has increasingly been used in relation to the spectrum  of evolutions faced in recent years by academia: more  involvement in economic and social development,  more intense commercialization of research results,  patent and licensing activities, the institutionalization  of spin off activities and managerial and attitudinal  changes among academics with respect to collab�orative projects with industry. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"This brings us to one of the biggest con�cerns of the opponents regarding an intensiffcation  of collaborations between universities and industries,  namely that the academic research agenda will be  ‘contaminated’ by the application-oriented needs of  industrial corporations—the ‘corporate manipulation  thesis’ (Noble, 1977). This view obviously counters  the theory on academic entrepreneurship (Slaughter  and Leslie, 1997; Etzkowitz et al., 1998, 2000).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;In this analysis, publication output is considered an  indicator of scientiffc performance. For this analysis,  only SCI covered publications have been taken into  account, given the systematic availability of the data  as they are available to all Flemish universities, be�cause of the WoS License of the Flemish Minister of  Education with ISI. For each division and for the rep�resented faculties, we assessed the publication perfor�mance of the faculty involved (professors).;An ANOVA was performed to examine the  degree to which publication numbers are inffuenced by  discipline (applied science, medicine, sciences, phar�macology and agricultural sciences), division mem�bership (0/1), science or technology domain (0/1) as  well as the basic versus applied domain (0/1). The re�sults of this analysis, with the number of publications  as dependent variable, can be found in Table 4.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"total amount of publications as a dependent variable.
";;;;;"Although the interaction effects are our major con�cern here, let us ffrst brieffy discuss the main effects,  which to a large extent conffrm previous ffndings.
Both discipline and division membership signiff-  cantly affect the amount of publications. The nature  of publications in terms of basic versus applied, does  not reveal any signiffcant differences. Stated other�wise, both categories are found in equal amounts  and variations within the sample examined. This is  not the case for the technology/science distinction.
Articles are more frequently found in science do�mains than within technology domains. Of course,  for the purpose of our analysis, the interaction ef�fects are of major concern. If the ‘skewing problem’  would manifest itself, interaction effects are to be  expected between division membership, on the one  hand, and the applied/basic and/or technology/science  distinction, on the other hand. Moreover, hypoth�esized differences—if the skewing problem would  be present—would go into the direction of more  applied publications in the case of division mem�bership, whereas the opposite would hold for basic  publications.

Even when  taking into account second- and third-order interac�tion effects, this basic pattern does not change: divi�sion members never publish less than their colleagues  not involved in divisional activities, and for the major�ity of the categories, division members publish more.
Hence, our data suggest no evidence for the skew�ing problem in terms of shifting towards the more ap�plied spectrum at the expense of more basic-oriente";;;"The thesis that the research agenda does not appear  to be skewed in the direction of a more applied na�ture was based on the categorization of the journals  on a basic-applied continuum. Additional questions  on whether the content and especially the conclusions  of basic science papers, are at all affected by more  applied and commercially driven activities could be  raised, especially when future patent applications may  be at stake. Such complementary questions imply an  in depth content analysis of article abstracts and could  spur more nuanced conclusions on the skewing prob�lem. Another useful addition to our analysis is the use  of other indicators for entrepreneurial performance in�stead of the mere execution of contract research. In  this respect, the authors are currently engaged in sim�ilar research addressing the possibilities of combining  patenting and scientiffc performance. Such analyses  might reveal to which extent patent fflings can be con�sidered a third wing to the Matthew-effect dealt with  in this article.

Van Looy 2006 - Publication and patent behavior of academic researchers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In this paper, we try to understand whether it is feasi�ble to balance scientiffc and entrepreneurial activities by  empirically examining the experiences of researchers at  a particular university, namely the Catholic University  of Leuven (K.U. Leuven), Belgium. Firstly, we provide  some background information on the approach followed  at K.U. Leuven as to the transfer of knowledge and  technology. We will then examine more closely the pub�lication behavior of inventors, i.e. academic staff actively  patenting the results of their research endeavors, in com�parison to the publication behavior of their peers working  in similar ffelds. A comparison of publication activity  will then allow us to address the central research ques�tions raised in the previous section.

Moreover, no empirical evidence was found for the ‘skewing problem’. ";;;;;;;;;;;"The follow�ing research questions are central to the empirical study:  • Do faculty members engaged in patenting activity  (inventors) publish less than their colleagues in com�parable research areas who are not engaged in such  invention activities?
• Do inventors differ from colleagues (non-inventors) in  terms of the nature of their publications? And if so, to  what extent does this difference coincide with a shift  towards more application-oriented publications?

It is clear that many  tensions and problems arise in the current transformation  taking place across the university landscape. As out�lined by Nelson (2004), this transformation raises impor�tant questions concerning the openness of the scientiffc  ‘enterprise’. While our ffndings reveal that reconcilia�tion between different activity realms appears feasible  in this particular university at the level of individual fac�ulty, increasing our understanding of how such positive  effects unfold – and under what conditions – is an issue  that should remain high on our research agendas.;;These ffndings also point to several interesting and  challenging avenues for further research. First of all, our  study needs to be complemented with research efforts  aimed at ‘external’ validation—using the same ffne�grained data type employed in this analysis but extrap�olating beyond the boundaries of K.U. Leuven. Spe�ciffc points for attention relate to latent, unintended or  unwanted consequences of the phenomena observed and  the precise nature of (institutional) arrangements foster�ing the co-existence of multiple objectives and, hence,  the achievement of both scientiffc and entrepreneurial  excellence. Such endeavors hold out the prospect of  enhancing our understanding of the impact that insti�tutional arrangements and incentive structures may have  on feasibly combining both types of activity in an aca�demic context—in short, their potential for helping or  hindering the process. In future research, it might also  prove worthwhile to include the impact of the publica�tion output (in terms of citations) and the involvement of  researchers in educational activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This is generally viewed as a complex of ‘all important economic, social,  political, organizational, institutional and other factors that inffuence the development, diffusion  and use of innovations’ [2]. A decade earlier, Freeman [3] deffned it as a ‘network of institutions  in the public and private sectors whose activities and interactions initiate, import and diffuse new  technologies’. From a broader perspective, universities, together with public R&D labs and science;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;agencies, public policies (on industry, research, innovation and higher education, etc.) and business  enterprises are now considered as important actors in the Asia-Paciffc economies. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Two features stand out that signify the transformation that is taking place. Firstly, there is the  coupling of teaching and research for the advancement of knowledge, which indicates the research  intensity in universities and HEIs. Secondly, the ability of these institutions to convert this research  potential to have an impact on society and industry [;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The three academic revolutions that were  identiffed and explored in this paper have led to three institutional missions in the role of universities,  namely, teaching, research, and innovation. Even though there are signiffcant variations in the way in  which all these three missions are combined in the role played by universities, there emerged three  types of universities, namely, teaching universities; teaching and research-based universities; and  the universities which combine all the three missions of teaching-research-innovation. Across the  Asia-Paciffc region, one can clearly identify the role of universities and higher educational institutions  emerging as important actors in the NIS to impact both economy and society. The NIS perspective was  useful to understand how different university and higher educational systems were structured and  organized to perform different roles in the national systems. More than anything else, this perspective  was useful to differentiate various institutional arrangements and policies in a comparative perspective  to examine how various elements and factors either facilitated and promoted or even constrained the  mission of universities in a particular pathway.
The orientation of teaching institutions to impart skills and training to emerging service and new  industrial sectors is a major shift that has come about in the last decade and a half in the Asia–Paciffc  region. Together with the massiffcation of higher education and remarkable increase in GER in the  Asian region, the share of the private sector’s role in higher education has witnessed tremendous  growth. Enrolments in private higher education as a percentage of total higher education registered  ffgures of 81% for Japan; 79% for South Korea; 64% for Singapore; 63% for the Philippines; and 62%  for Indonesia.
The NIS perspective yielded three groupings. In the ffrst group are Australia, Japan, South Korea,  China, Taiwan, and Singapore, which are investing between 2% to 4% of their GDP in R&D. All  these countries not only enacted robust UIL and triple helix policies but have also made substantial  investments in making speciffc institutional arrangements to foster and promote them. In the second
J. Open Innov. Technol. Mark. Complex. 2019, 5, 43 18 of 21  group are India, Malaysia, and New Zealand, which are investing from 0.75% to 1.25% of their GDP in  R&D and which have made only modest institutional arrangements and investments to promote UIL  and triple helix measures. In the third group, we have SE Asian economies (Indonesia, the Philippines,  Vietnam, and Thailand), where one can ffnd the real gap between policy rhetoric on UIL, triple helix,  and their implementation. Much of the inability of these countries to make institutional arrangements  and implement policies to foster UIL and triple helix seems to be due to very low level of their national  investments in R&D.
The NIS perspective was useful in exploring certain historical developments in the Asia-Paciffc  region. Japan and South Korea, in their initial stages of industrialization from the1970s to 1990s,  were heavily dependent on highly skilled educated work force trained in specialized technical  and higher educational institutions. Institutional arrangements were organized in such a way  as to facilitate large business corporations (Sony, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Hyundai, and Samsung, for  example) to exploit technological frontiers in achieving international competitiveness. Much of the  technological advancement and generation of wealth in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan came about  through knowledge and technology institutions, thereby reffecting more ‘advanced environments’  compared to SE Asian countries. Historically speaking, unlike Australia and New Zealand, these  three Asian economies advanced technologically through science, technology, and higher educational  institutional base.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2013). However, they are likely to interact as stated by Link et al. (2007): “Research sug�gests that formal and informal technology transfer may go well together in that informal   contacts improve the quality of a formal relationship or that formal contracts are accom�panied by an informal relation of mutual exchange on technology-related aspects.” The   literature provides some static evidence based on cross-section studies which suggest that   the diferent UIKT channels are correlated (D’Este and Patel 2007; Grimpe and Hussinger   2013). Yet, little attention has been paid to the dynamic setting, which enables an under�standing of how the diferent UIKT channels interact over time and put forward specifc   dynamic patterns of interactions. An exception is a recent research study by Azagra-Caro   et al. (2017) which focuses on the case of a highly cited university patent that provides an   interesting insight into the temporality and spatial dimension of the interplay between for�mal and informal UIKT channels.

With regard to managerial and policy implications, this research suggests in   particular that we should be very careful when evaluating mechanisms of research valoriza�tion at a single point in time.

In Australia, studies have shown that  the industry is hesitant to adopt academic research,  instead largely wanting statistics and marketing-based  information (Cooper et al., 2006; Thomas, 2012). Any  abstract ideas and ways of interpreting or conceptualis�ing issues that create knowledge about the social  tourism world are only welcomed by industry prac�titioners if they can ffnd an immediate application for  it within their context (Thomas, 2012).
";;;;;;;" For instance, knowledge creation versus  development of marketable products/services, pure  research versus directed and applied, and public good  or open research versus closed or commercial in-conff-  dence (Fuchs, 2011; Seigel et al., 2003; Sobaih & Jones,  2015; Valentín, 2000). Academic researchers have also  been criticised by industry users for their timeliness,  communication, and conffdentiality (Barnes et al., 2002;  Melissen & Koens, 2016; Parallada & Sanromà, 2000;  Santoro & Bierly, 2006; Schoffeld, 2013; Sobaih & Jones,  2015; Valentín, 2000), and not paying sufffcient attention  to the needs of industry (Craig-Lees, Scott, & Wong, 2008;  Parallada & Sanromà, 2000; Schoffeld, 2013; Seigel et al.,  2003).";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; As uni�versities are key stakeholders in knowledge creation for  organisational innovation, collaborations between uni�versities and industry are arguably critical for developing  a knowledge-based economy and creating sustainable  competitive advantage (Sobaih & Jones, 2015). Y;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"As such, consultants are preferred  who are considered to be more in tune with the com�mercial world. Other studies have found that while  industry do believe that academics understand their  respective ‘industry’, they do not understand industry  research needs (Craig-Lees et al., 2008; Parallada &  Sanromà, 2000; Wood, 2017).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"As a result, there has been an increased  emphasis on what has been described as a ‘third mission’  whereby universities foster direct links with knowledge  users or ‘industry’ (De Fuentes & Dutrénit, 2012; Etzko�witz, Webster, Gebhardt, & Terra, 2000; Göransson,  Maharajh, & Schmoch, 2009; Perkman et al., 2013).

For academics seeking to become more competitive in  the research market they can use their expertise as a  competitive advantage. Overall though, the ffndings of  this study suggest there is some way to go in shifting  industry’s perceptions if academics are to be competitive  in the research market.
";;"inally, the authors acknowledge that the ffndings of  this study represent just one dimension of the broad  and complicated research agenda that academic  researchers are usually working within. This study has  solely provided insights for those researchers that are  looking to enhance the nature and extent to which  they engage with industry and we appreciate this does  not reffect the goals and objectives of all academic  researchers. We also acknowledge that there are many  academics who have very successful and long-term  working relationships with industry; indeed some  working at a level described by Van de Ven (2007) as  ‘engaged scholarship’. This study has presented the per�spectives of a sample of Australian industry participants  and we do not claim that the ffndings are generalisable  to all academic researchers either in Australia or  elsewhere.
";;"This study set the basis for future research to further  explore ways to effectively market academics and their  research. Marketing interventions designed to alter the  current perceptions of academic researchers and  acquire a competitive market position need to be empiri�cally tested to determine the most effective means of  generating awareness and engagement opportunities.
Survey research could also be conducted to explore  the prevalence of the key themes revealed in this study  which would substantiate the conclusions drawn from  this qualitative study. Finally, the current study focused  on industry practioners who had previously collaborated  with academics as this was essential to gain detailed  insight into what was behind their perceptions. Future  research could explore the views of those who have  not worked with academics to extend our knowledge  further on the reasons behind their reluctance or inability  to engage.

White 2019 - The soft side of knowledge transfer partnerships;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted in each of  the three organizations (i.e. cases). This was further com�pleted with 40 hours of on-site observation and the com�pilation of instantaneously-sampled field notes in each of the  three organizations (Paolisso and Hames 2010), to the point  of theoretical saturation (Guest, Bunce, and Johnson 2006).
Interviews were also conducted with each KTP Associate  responsible for conducting the business process improve�ments in each organization, and this was done for all three  organizations (i.e. cases). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"KEYWORDS  Knowledge transfer  partnership; SMEs;  university; case study;  process improvement";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;The aim of this paper is to uncover the issues which emerge during formation of a partnership  between heterogeneous organizations and universities. In addition, the study unfolds the criticalities  of typical process improvement capability that supports the knowledge transfer partnerships between  universities and SMEs. ;;;;;;;;;;;The nascent nature of the  dynamics of university–industry relationships on the soft side  of knowledge transfer partnerships requires a research  design as the one adopted for this study (see Figure 2) to  answer: (a) the ‘how’ (how does the dynamics of university�industry relationships enable firms to implement and lever�age the power of soft side of knowledge transfer partner�ships for enabling innovation?) and (b) the ‘why’ (the  motivations and impacts of university-industry relationships  for enabling innovation). ;;;;;;; It is well known that using yesteryear  tools will not yield a competitive advantage to firms and it  has been perceived by some to replace lean principles, in  particular, total quality management (TQM), as the funda�mental means by which many organizations can achieve  competitive advantage (Ju et al. 2006). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Knowledge management has been described in a range  of studies as the use of Information Technology to aid the  collection and dissemination of knowledge, as the general  process of acquiring and disseminating knowledge (Alavi and  Leidner 2001), as the complex interaction and knowledge  exchange between individuals, groups and organization  (Small and Sage 2005) and as the transfer of knowledge  between organizations.. It has been said that key to the  study of knowledge management is the concept of  ‘knowledge productivity’ that is ‘the production of knowledge  in some distributable form’ (Tillema 2006, 174). ;"Schemes such as knowledge transfer accounts (KTAs) exist to  provide funding for university–industry knowledge acquisi�tion and may be used to fund knowledge transfer partner�ships (KTPs). Knowledge exchange opportunities (KEOs) also  exist that are outwardly similar to KTPs but focus on support�ing the linkages between social sciences and the commercial  world. Further, shorter schemes, such as Strategic Insight  Programmes (SIPs) also exist that aim to fund the establish�ment of links between university and commerce but without  undertaking such significant programmes of work or know�ledge acquisition.
";;"Knowledge Management has been studied in a range of con�texts from international and multinational business, to proj�ects (Eskerod and Skriver 2007; DeFillippi et al. 2006),  consultancies and individual organizational case studies  (Khalil et al. 2006). The management of knowledge has been  discussed as a necessary core competence for modern organ�izations that seek to obtain and maintain competitive advan�tage (Geiger 2011). It is well known that using yesteryear  tools will not yield a competitive advantage to firms and it  has been perceived by some to replace lean principles, in  particular, total quality management (TQM), as the funda�mental means by which many organizations can achieve  competitive advantage (Ju et al. 2006). ";;;;;;;;;;" The term ‘knowledge  acquisition’ is used in this study as it reflects the multi�faceted nature and perspectives of knowledge in an organ�izational context. The literature discusses many knowledge�based themes including the importance and benefits for  organizations to create new knowledge, for organizations to  utilize existing knowledge, the systems and methods that  facilitate knowledge use and the importance of the individ�ual as well as the collective. In doing so the terms  ‘knowledge management’, ‘knowledge transfer’, ‘knowledge  production’ and ‘knowledge creation’, among others, are  used, often interchangeably. The term ‘knowledge acquisi�tion’ encompasses these terms and is one that is  frequently used in the literature for this purpose  (Alonderiene et al. 2006; Clark and Geppert 2002; Gupta and  Govindarajan 2000).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;Knowledge transfer is widely emphasized as a strategic  issue for firm competition. Knowledge transfer has to be reli�able and codified (Albino et al. 1998). Social exchange plays  a vital role in knowledge transfer between partners  (Muthusamy and White 2005) and can influence the nature  of the partnership. Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs)  facilitate the relationship between university and organiza�tions and are equally applicable to the acquisition of tech�nical knowledge and business management knowledge (KTP  2013a). ;;;;;;;;University–industry knowledge transfer can unfold in  many ways and impacts multiple stakeholders, especially in  highly differentiated university systems (Rossi and Rosli  2015). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;" Phases of KTP development  PMapping afforded an effective means of acquiring know�ledge of the key business processes along with their associ�ated business processes. This enabled Associates to confirm  or refine KTP objectives and identify productive work to  undertake. Process mapping was found to be an important  facilitator of socialization that can contribute to effective  knowledge acquisition (Nonaka and Konno 1998; Nonaka  1994). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Associate integration  One of the immediate issues that faced KTPs was the inte�gration of the project Associate with the partner organiza�tion. Even though the Associates underwent formal  induction programmes these were insufficient by themselves  to fully immerse the individual with the organization; Associate motivation  Each KTP underwent a period of time, in some cases a con�siderable portion of the overall project duration, where the  Associate experienced a great degree of frustration and  demotivation. The sources of frustration ranged from a lack  of clear and stable project objectives to internal resistance to  change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;This research finds that KTPs in different sectors of com�merce, with differing objectives, appear to mature through  three similar phases of development. These stages are char�acterized by gradual reductions in the level of communica�tion between the KTP Associates and Academic Supervisors,  and increases in the degree of socialization of the Associate  with other employees. During the early stages, the  Associates experience high degrees of self-criticism. Later  stages require careful management to maintain project  momentum, in particular through intervention between the  Associates and other, often senior, staff in the organization.;; Earlier research work didn’t  find any evidence that KTP Associates require considerable  support, however, this research highlights that KTP  Associates require considerable support in overcoming insti�tutional resistance and self-criticism that can be a source of  emotional turmoil and stress. Commercial partnering organi�zations must be selected and managed with care to ensure  that funds are used most effectively. Academic partnering  organizations must recognize the challenge that KTPs pre�sent and must select, train and support staff appropriately;;"Future research should explore the ways in which KTPs  develop and mature. Researchers may explore how the KTP  Associate’s communication with other individuals fluctuates  during the time of KTP. It would be useful to understand if  the phases identified in this study are common to partner�ships undertaken with other universities and organizations,  or if they are determined in some way by the type of work  that is undertaken.

Wit-de Vries 2018 - Knowledge transfer in university–industry research partnerships;;;;;;;;;;;;The initial search strategy was to fnd papers discussing “research partnership*”, “academic   engagement” or papers that combined “scienc*, academi* or university” with “indus�try* or business”, in combination with “knowledge management”, “knowledge transfer”   or “technology transfer”. This, however, did not provide many useful results. Therefore,   we changed the search strategy to an approach in which we used broad Boolean search   strings to identify papers on academic engagement from which we manually selected the   ones that discuss research partnerships in relation to knowledge transfer. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Absorptive capacity refers to the ability to recognize, assimilate and apply new external   knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal 1990). The capability of frms to absorb new knowledge   depends on the shared knowledge base of the academics and the frm employees. It has a   strong relationship with causal ambiguity, as it also strongly depends on a shared knowl�edge base (Cohen and Levinthal 1990).

The term cultural difer�ences is used to indicate a lack of shared meaning and social conventions (Tsai and Gho�shal 1998). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; university–industry research   partnerships;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;They relate to diferences in knowledge background between the   frm and the academics. Similarity in knowledge backgrounds makes it easier to understand   and absorb new knowledge that results from the collaboration. Knowledge ambiguity refers   to a situation where dissimilarities in knowledge result in “inherent and irreducible uncer�tainty regarding what the underlying knowledge components and sources are precisely, and   how they interact” (van Wijk et al. 2008). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Knowledge transfer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;In this paper we aim to map extant knowledge and perspectives on knowledge transfer   in academic engagement through a systematic literature review. Additionally, we identify   open questions for future research. Besides our aim to develop a theoretical perspective to   study academic engagement our focus on knowledge transfer adds to previous reviews on   academic engagement.;;;;;;;Knowledge transfer in university–industry research   partnerships: a review;;;;;;;;;This paper identifes practices that can facilitate knowledge transfer in univer�sity–industry (U–I) research partnerships by systematically reviewing extant literature. We   aim to contribute to the theoretical development in the feld of academic engagement and   propose that knowledge transfer provides a valuable perspective. ;;;;;;;;;;; We aim to realize generalization and accumulation of   knowledge and to identify issues which are inconclusive or have been ignored in the extant   literature and provide practices that facilitate the management of academic engagement in   practice.;;;;;;;"o defne knowledge transfer we used the defnition by Bloedon and Stokes (1994, p. 
44) who defned this as ‘the process by which knowledge concerning the making or doing   of useful things contained within one organized setting is brought into use within another   organizational context’. Knowledge transfer practices are then defned as the activities that   facilitate what is needed to bring knowledge into use in another organization’s context,   such as, teaching, the management of interactions and sharing data and technology.
";;"Social capital in the form of tie strength and trust refects the closeness of a relation�ship and positively infuences knowledge transfer (Bloedon and Stokes 1994; Bruneel et al. 
2010; Davenport et al. 1998; Santoro and Gopalakrishnan 2001). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;There are not many papers that focus explicitly on knowledge transfer in academic   engagement (Bruneel et al. 2010). To fnd literature that discusses knowledge transfer we   frst identifed the factors that afect knowledge transfer in inter-organizational collabora�tion. This can be justifed when we follow the logic that academic engagement is a spe�cifc form of inter-organizational collaboration or alliance (see for example Galan-Muros   and Plewa 2016). ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The second important factor that infuences knowledge absorption, is diferences in   knowledge background, referred to as cognitive and epistemic diference. They result in   diferences in ‘language’ and diferent logics regarding what methods should be used. 
Therefore, relatedness of prior knowledge and technological competence help to under�stand and integrate new knowledge (Daghfous 2004; Santoro and Bierly 2006) and reduces   ambiguity.";;Ulhøi et al. (2012) focus specifcally at the knowledge contribution of the industrial   partner. They sketch a much more dynamic exchange process, in which the industrial   application of research outcomes directly infuences academic research. This discrep�ancy is partly explained by McCabe et al. (2016) who discusses three levels of collabo�ration, low, high and deep, and links them to diferent knowledge exchange practices. In   collaborations with low engagement the frm is seen as data source, while all research   activities are controlled and conducted by the academic partner. ;;;;"Nonaka (1994) developed the knowledge creation circle to explain tacit knowledge   transfer. Which shows that tacit knowledge is transferred in four steps; (1) through cre�ating shared experiences (socialization), after which knowledge is (2) externalized,   (3) recombined and (4) internalized. ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The term ‘research’ generated results for a broad range of terms used   to indicate collaborations such as joint research, collaborative research, contract research   and so on. Our search terms were based on previous reviews by Ankrah and AL-Tabbaa   (2015) and Perkmann et al. (2013). The results from the Boolean search from the three lit�erature databases were combined in Rayyan (Ouzzani et al. 2016). In total we found about   890 unique papers.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The relevance of ambiguity and absorptive capacity in the context of U–I collaboration   was confrmed by Santoro and Bierly (2006). They showed that technological relatedness   and technological capability (which increases absorptive capacity) were the most important   facilitators of knowledge transfer in U–I collaborations. In the same study, tacitness and   explicitness (related to knowledge ambiguity) moderated knowledge transfer negatively.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;We found that research into knowl�edge transfer in academic engagement is dispersed. This could be due to incoherence in ;;"We noticed that “cultural diferences” is used as an aggregated term for diferent goals,   organizational and managerial diferences and epistemic norms. This is problematic as it   makes it hard to understand the cause-efect relations of the individual aspects of cultural   diferences on knowledge transfer. Research that diferentiates between cognitive or goal   related diferences and routine based diferences indicates that these factors afect collabo�rations diferently (Corley et al. 2006; Estrada et al. 2016). A more structured approach is   required which distinguishes between the efects of single attributes of cultural diferences   and their efect on collaboration success and knowledge transfer.";;"We found two promising lines of research. The frst, deals with the cognitive diferences   and the adsorption of knowledge. The second, with diferences in goals and the applicabil�ity of knowledge. We also identifed the most relevant factors and practices for the mitiga�tion of these diferences. Trust and communication help to overcome both, cognitive difer�ences and diferences in goals. Intermediaries mainly help to reduce cognitive diferences,   and experience primarily helps to resolve diferences is goals.

Xie 2021 - The spatial-temporal complexity and dynamics of research collaboration;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;First, based on organizational attribute, inter-organizational colla�boration can be divided into four patterns. They are referred to as EE   (collaborations between enterprises) if assignees consist only of en�terprises, AA (collaborations between academic institutions) if as�signees consist only of academic institutions (including universities,   colleges, and research institutions), AE (collaborations between aca�demic institutions and enterprises) if assignees consist of both academic   institutions and enterprises, OP (other pattern collaborations) if as�signees consist of government departments or armies and academic   institutions or enterprises).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Research collaboration   Intra- and inter-city   Network   Regional innovation   Patent   China ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Fourth, based on previous research (Guan et al., 2015), we advance   a model of multilevel networks between cities. We use co-patent to   obtain inter-organizational relationship. Then the addresses of organi�zations located in cities are used to obtain inter-city collaborative net�works. Specifically, at the city level, according to addresses of co-patent   assignees, if all organizations of one co-patent are located in different   cities, the co-patent constructs an inter-city linkage. The sum of lin�kages between every pair of organizations reflect the collaborative   strength. All inter-city linkages in a city consist of an inter-city network   that actors are cities and ties are inter-city linkages (Sun and   Grimes, 2017).;;"According to a longitudinal dataset containing 297 cities in China   over a 32-year period (1985–2016), this study contributes to advance   previous studies in two ways. First, previous studies focus on the effect   of collaboration on innovation performance (Guan et al., 2015, 2016;   Wang et al., 2014), but the evolution of collaboration may enhance us   to understand the role of collaboration in innovation from another   perspective. Based on a two-dimension quadrant (TDQ) analytical fra�mework and social network analysis (SNA), our approach tries to ex�plore both spatial-temporal evolution of patterns and dynamics of col�laborative network. Second, although Sun (2016) reveals the structure   and dynamics of networks within and between regions at provincial   level in China, the likely feature of inter-regional network at the city   level may be uncertain and diverse.";;;;;;;we explore the evolution of intra- and inter-city   research collaboration and dynamics of inter-city network with a two-dimension quadrant analytical framework   and social network analysis. ;;;;"We intend to extend research re�vealing the structure and dynamics of collaborative network, and   consider the impact of city location on its contribution in the network. 
This approach will help to understand cross-organizational activities   collaboration at the city level. 
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Following an increasing amount of knowledge creation, innovation   has become a complex activity (Guan et al., 2016). Organizations have   to expand their partnerships to stay innovative and maintain a com�petitive advantage, because the diversity and richness of knowledge for   organizations is limited (De Noni et al., 2018). T;;"Participation in collaboration can let innovation actors take ad�vantage of opportunities in knowledge exchange and innovation   output, through a combination of diversifying knowledge and im�proving the knowledge creation process (Asheim et al., 2011;   Belussi et al., 2010; Cantner et al., 2010).";;;;"In regional innovation systems, research collaboration is often cross�organizational and usually formed from different innovation actors   including enterprises, universities and research institutions   (Pekkarinen and Harmaakorpi, 2006; Sun, 2016). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Third, in order to learn about the balance of intra- and inter- city   collaborations, we apply TDQ to analysis relationship between intra�and inter- CCI. S;;;;;;We collect 5.05 million invention patent applications that were   submitted for application between 1985 and 2016 in China. Based on   these patents, we carry out a series of data cleaning. First, deleted all   patents with single assignee and obtain co-patents. Second, delete all   co-patents with individual assignees (we cannot find their addresses).;;;;;; AE and EE collaboration   According to the above analysis, AE and EE are the two most im�portant patterns of research collaborations. Therefore, we use AE and   EE to set up TDQ. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;For the purpose of learning about the evolution of inter-organiza�tional collaboration at the city level, we use two-dimensional quadrant   (TDQ) and set up the average value of cities from 1985 to 2016 as the   cut-off point for distinguishing the high and low levels of city colla�boration intensity (CCI) and city innovation capability (CIC) (CCI=   6.509, CIC=1.356). The distribution of CCI and CIC had changed. In   the first period, innovation capability of 210 cities involving in colla�boration were all lower than 1.356 (Fig. 2 and Appendix A1). However,   collaboration intensity of the half of these cities were higher than   6.509. These indicate that cities have weak innovation capabilities but   high collaboration intensity. The reason could be that a lot of cities   have a few patents in this period and a few co-patents would lead to a   high collaboration intensity. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Several insightful findings from this paper may be of interest. First,   CCI and CIC have gradually increased, and the polarization of colla�boration has been highlighted. A lot of cities separate in their paths in   four periods. I;;"There are several limitations in our study. First, only the data of   joint invention patent application was applied to create our database of   research collaboration. Patents have some advantages on indicating   research output, but we have to admite that there are other research   outputs. Merely using co-patent data might lead to results bias. 
Exploiting a more comprehensive assessment that integrates co-patent   and other collaboration links (such as co-authored paper, project col�laboration, technology transaction and human talent exchange) might   be necessary. Second, although the sample cities accounting for more   than 90% innovation resource are the absolute main cores of regional   innovation and research collaboration in China, we neglect some cities   that are autonomous prefectures and county-level cities administered   by provinces directly. ";;"For all studies of research collaboration, it is   normal to select cities. However, this might have the possibility of in�fluencing our conclusions. Future research may consider more cities in   China. Third, findings from our study are based on the unique context   of Mainland China at the city level, which may lead to a biased inter�pretation of our findings (Sun and Cao, 2015). It is necessary for re�searchers to consider changes of the context when our results are ap�plied to other countries.

Yongli Tang (2019) - University‑industry interaction and product innovation performance of Guangdong manufacturing firms;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;To achieve these objectives, we based our research on a government supported survey   conducted at Qingxi Town of Dongguan City, located centrally in the Pearl River Delta   (PRD) of Guangdong Province, where frms are supported by the government to engage in   active interaction with not only intra-regional but also cross-regional universities to com�pensate the defciency of local university resources ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;University-industry interaction · Knowledge transfer · Product innovation ·   Proximity · University research quality · China;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;University‑industry interaction;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;We collected data on the extent to which a sample of 166   Guangdong manufacturing frms draw from the intra-regional and cross-regional univer�sities, as well as high-quality and average-quality universities.;;This study aims to investigate the direct relationships of university proximity and research   quality with the product innovation performance of Chinese frms engaging in diverse   university interaction channels. ;;;;;;;;;;;"Hypothesis 2 A frm’s interaction with cross-regional universities is more strongly associ�ated with radical product innovations than with incremental ones.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"In our case, a frms’ intra-regional and cross-regional university linkages exhibit varying   degrees of not only spatial distances, but also sub-national institutional diferences. Such   variances in geographical and institutional proximity will inevitably exhibit diferential   associations with frm product incremental and radical innovation performance.
";;;;"Academic resources and research capabilities distribute unevenly across universities. The   most valuable resources and capabilities are more likely to be concentrated in the top-rank   universities than the average ones. As a result, interaction with universities of diferent lev�els of research quality will afect the types of benefts that the frms could obtain for their   innovation (Bishop et al. 2011).
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"we turn to university research quality that has been identifed as another important   determinant factor of university-industry interaction alongside geographical proximity ever   since the work of Mansfeld (1995) and Mansfeld and Lee (1996). Extant studies have   shown that research quality not only infuences university researchers’ attitudes towards   academic performance and industry involvement (Giuliani and Arza 2009; Perkmann et al. 
2011), but also afect frm expectations with regard to innovation benefts from university   collaboration (Mansfeld and Lee 1996; Laursen et al. 2011). ";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Thus, by distinguishing intra-regional and   cross-regional linkages, our concept of regional proximity captures both the geographical   and institutional proximity of the universities to the local frms.;;"Average-quality universities may not possess top-level scientists and frontier   research capabilities, thus restricting their contributions to frm radical innovations. 
However, they may have a higher proportion of researchers, who have limited interests   in or capabilities to undertaking ‘blue sky’ research but higher preference to engage in   more problem-solving research related to frm incremental innovations (Giuliani and   Arza 2009). ";;;;;;;"Data collection was supported by the Science, Technology and Innovation Service Cen�tre (STISC) of Qingxi Town. We frst obtained a full list of all the manufacturing frms   in the town whose annual total sales is equal to or greater than RMB 20 million in 2014. 
We choose these frms because they have higher R&D intensity and innovation capability   compared to smaller frms, and also because STISC maintains closer contacts with these   frms in their daily work. There are totally 293 frms in the list. Besides company names, a   4-digit sectoral classifcation code (GB/T 4754-2011) for each company was also provided   in the list.
The survey was conducted between December 2015 and January 2016. An e-mail   including the questionnaire and a cover letter was sent to all frms in the list. In the cover   letter, we specially requested that the respondent should be the General Manager/CEO, or   the CTO/Director of R&D department. The STISC then helped us collect the completed   questionnaires in paper form. By the end of January 2016, totally 219 questionnaires were   returned. Among them, 40 were invalid because of missing data. Another 13 frms were   eliminated because they only were established within the last 3 years. In the questionnaire,   we explicitly indicated in each question that the time period referred to is for the 3 years   from 2012 to 2014. Thus the 13 frms founded after 2012 were excluded because they   could not provide enough information. In the end, a fnal sample of 166 valid responses   were obtained resulting in a response rate of 56.7%.1  The main characteristics of the frms in the sample are as shown in Table 1. We grouped   the frms into 5 industrial sectors according to their 2-digit sectoral classifcation codes   (GB/T 4754-2011). As indicated in the Table, frm size (employees, and sales), frm age   and R&D personnel vary greatly across these industrial groups.
";;;;;;;" we defne product innovation as the   market introduction of a product that is new or signifcantly improved with respect to   its characteristics or intended use, which excludes the simple resale of new goods pur�chased from other companies and changes of a solely aesthetic nature (OECD 2005; CIS   2010). According to CIS (2010), product innovations (new or improved) must be new to   the frm, but they do not need to be new to the market.
";;;;;" We   thus control for a frm’s varied university interaction channels, which is measured follow�ing D’Este and Patel (2007), by the number of diferent types of channels that the frm is   engaged in simultaneously. This approach has also been furthered tested in several subse�quent studies including Bruneel et al. (2010), Wang et al. (2015), and Bruneel et al. (2016).
In the questionnaire, we asked the frms to indicate on a seven-point Likert-type scale   (1=Not used; 4=Medium importance; 7=Key channel) the importance of knowledge   obtained from a list of 14 interaction channels in support for its internal innovation activi�ties for the past 3 years 2012–2014.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;In terms of regional proximity, we measured whether a frm interacts with intra-regional   universities (items 1–5) and cross-regional universities (items 6–10) as dichotomous vari�ables, whereby the variables=1 if any of the related items has a score≥2, or 0 otherwise;;;;;;"In this regard, we   accounted for the efect of a frm’s overall intensity of interaction with universities, which   is simply measured as the average score of the all the 10 items in Table 2. This variable has   high scale reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.96.
";;;;;;;;;;;"First, this study reveals   the diferential associations of university proximity and research quality with incremen�tal and radical product innovations. The results show that a frm’s interaction with intra�regional universities is more strongly associated with incremental product innovations,   whereas interaction with cross-regional universities is more strongly associated with   radical product innovations; average-quality university linkages have a stronger relation�ship with incremental product innovations, while high-quality university linkages have a   stronger relationship with radical product innovations.";;" The frst limi�tation concerns the generalizability of our fndings. The frms in our sample are manufac�turing frms located in one specialized town (Qingxi) in Guangdong, and may not represent 
Y. Tang et al.
1 3  many other Chinese frms in less developed regions that have less investment in R&D. Our   concept of university regional proximity is defned on the basis of sub-national institutional   variance and geographical scale of China’s territory, which may not be suitable for other   emerging economies. In addition, our measurement of research quality of Chinese univer�sities and research institutes based on their inclusion in the 985 and 211 programs or afli�ation to CAS is also specifc to the Chinese context.

By using   the cooperative mechanism between technological   innovation subject and knowledge creation subject [2-5],   enterprises, universities, and scientific research institutes   can realize the cooperative effect among different subjects   (n + n > 2n) and the cooperative creation within a single   subject (1 + 1 > 2).
";;;;;;;Thus, this study focuses on the cause and process of   knowledge stickiness in the context of collaborative   innovation of IUR. ;;;;;;;;;;;"This study also analyzes the basic   hypothesis that the factors influencing knowledge   stickiness between IUR are mainly activity stickiness,   cognitive stickiness, and situational stickiness, namely, E =   f(C, W, Q). Where E represents total knowledge stickiness,   C represents cognitive layer knowledge stickiness, W  represents activity layer knowledge stickiness, and Q  represents situation stickiness.
";;;;;;;Cummings   and Teng [22] pointed out that the key factors affecting the   success of knowledge transfer include the expressiveness   and embeddedness of knowledge, knowledge distance,   project priority, and transfer activities.

[23] found that to some extent, the generation of   knowledge stickiness can be avoided by knowledge   characteristics, learning intention, resource attraction, and   partnership. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Factors that affect knowledge stickiness include   subjective factors, such as knowledge source and   knowledge receptor [18], and objective factors, such as   knowledge characteristics and situation [19, 20]. 
Researchers have different analyses on the causes of   knowledge stickiness from different perspectives. 
Szulanski [21] thought that knowledge stickiness was   affected by knowledge characteristics, knowledge sources,   knowledge receptors, and transfer situations. Cummings   and Teng [22] pointed out that the key factors affecting the   success of knowledge transfer include the expressiveness   and embeddedness of knowledge, knowledge distance,   project priority, and transfer activities. Pérez-Nordtvedt et   al. [23] found that to some extent, the generation of   knowledge stickiness can be avoided by knowledge   characteristics, learning intention, resource attraction, and   partnership. ";;;;"Von Hipple [10] first proposed the concept of ""sticky   information"". He believed that the process of knowledge   acquisition or knowledge transfer entailed cost, and   information stickiness was directly proportional to the cost. 
Szulanski [14] & Simonin [15] put forward the concepts of   ""internal viscosity"" and ""knowledge fuzziness"",  respectively. From then on, scholars began paying   attention to ""knowledge stickiness"" and carried out   numerous researches. The local definitions of knowledge   stickiness are mainly cost theory and knowledge theory";;;;;;;Knowledge has become the most strategic resource for   enterprises [29-31]. Under the background of knowledge   modularization and labor division [32], enterprises   constantly seek cooperation with universities and scientific   research institutes to provide competitive advantages for   their technological innovation and development [33, 34]. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Based on the collaborative innovation environment of   IUR, this study mainly discusses the knowledge stickiness   with its own research characteristics. The theoretical model   of knowledge stickiness elements of IUR is proposed to   enhance the pertinence and rationality of the indicators in   the specific context and to form a systematic,   comprehensive, reasonable, and specific variable that   affects knowledge stickiness. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Universities and scientific research institutes provide   new knowledge (variable is set as U(t)), enterprises accept   new knowledge to complete the transformation of   scientific and technological achievements (variable is set   as F(t)), and the main quality parameter is the output of   each knowledge subject of IUR. Based on the fact that all   essential productive factors are constant, a superior limit   boundary exists between the university-research party and   the industry party. The saturation quantity is U , F . To  assume that the natural growth rate of output between IUR   is r1, r2, the logistic growth equation among knowledge   subjects of IUR is as follows:  1 0  2 0  d () ( ) () 1 d  d () ( ) () 1 d  U t U t rU t  t U  F t F t rF t  t F     = −           = −       ;;;;;;"Knowledge is characterized by complexity,   recessiveness, and exclusiveness (represented by W1, W2,  W3, respectively, Wi ∈ [0, 1]; i = 1, 2, 3). The closer the   value of Wi is to 0, the less complex the knowledge is. The   closer the value of Wi, the more complex it is.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"To ensure that the relationship between factors in   collaborative innovation of IUR and knowledge stickiness   can be further reflected, this study puts forward the analysis   framework of knowledge stickiness in collaborative   innovation of IUR. This study also analyzes the basic   hypothesis that the factors influencing knowledge   stickiness between IUR are mainly activity stickiness,   cognitive stickiness, and situational stickiness, namely, E =   f(C, W, Q). Where E represents total knowledge stickiness,   C represents cognitive layer knowledge stickiness, W  represents activity layer knowledge stickiness, and Q  represents situation stickiness.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"(1) Factors such as the university-research party, the   industry party, cognitive structure differences, knowledge   characteristics, relationship between industry-university�research, and situation have impacts on knowledge   stickiness among subjects. The process of knowledge   transfer is the process of initiating, implementing,   adjusting, and integrating knowledge.
(2) The process of knowledge transfer between IUR is   the process of knowledge increment and knowledge   creation, and the process of knowledge quantity evolution   between IUR is the process of continuous approximation   between the industry party and the university-research   party. The knowledge of the university-research party is   learned and used by the industry party constantly to deepen   its thinking and improve its ability, and the university�research party accumulates practical experience through   the feedback of the enterprise.
(3) Knowledge stickiness has a direct impact on the   efficiency of knowledge transfer. The effect of cognitive   stickiness is more evident than that of situational stickiness. 
Compared with the cognitive stickiness layer, stickiness   coefficient of different situations has significantly different   effects on the knowledge quantity. 
(4) The degree of knowledge stickiness is inversely   proportional to the cooperation atmosphere and the   situation, showing that the stickiness effect of knowledge   can be effectively weakened by creating a good   collaborative innovation environment.";;"In addition, the knowledge transmission model   based on heat conduction theory lacks practical verification,   which needs to be supported by specific cases in reality. 
Finally, expanding the study on knowledge stickiness   between IUR is necessary to provide reference for   knowledge management (transfer and sharing) in China.

The statistical analysis is based mainly on the Regression Tree Method and   Spearman correlation coefficient. The interview-based research among key actors involved in   preparation of firms’ problem-oriented student theses confirmed the high effectiveness of this   method of knowledge transfer from universities to industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; creativity, higher education, entrepreneurship, knowledge transfer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Industry;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Knowledge Transfer;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Universities ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"Testing period 2017.04.03−2018.03.01. 400 emails were sent to students’ thesis supervisors   at 5 universities in Krakow (Cracow University of Economics, AGH University of Science and   Technology, Cracow University of Technology, University of Agriculture in Krakow and The Faculty   of Industrial Design at The Academy of Fine Arts) asking for interviews in cases of a supervised   thesis being oriented to solving a firm’s problems. In effect, 62 positive answers were received, and   150 interviews were conducted by the end of February 2018 with members of teams consisting of a   university teacher, a student and a representative of the company for which each thesis was   developed (24 in the field of technology, 16 in industrial design, 7 in economics and 3 in   agriculture). Questionnaire-based interviews were performed by groups of students coordinated by   us. Interviews covered 9 engineering thesis, 15 bachelor and 26 master thesis. 20 thesis supervisors   had a PhD title, 27 were associate professors, and 3 were full professors. In the Polish higher   education system, student theses are prepared over a period of 1 to 3 semesters; they require a   structured written form, are reviewed by an external reviewer, and are formally defended. Most of   the interviews are available in Polish on-line at www.innowacyjnystart.pl, which is a regional   platform dedicated to innovation policy (some of the respondents’ statements from these   interviews are quoted in this paper). The statistical analysis presented below is based mainly on the   Regression Tree Method (Breiman et al., 1984) and Spearman correlation coefficient.";;;The objective of this paper is to explore the role of student theses developed in response to   specific firms’ problems under the supervision of university teachers as an innovative teaching   method with a high level of personal engagement. ;;;;;;;;;;"There is a relationship between the declared degree of extension   of student skills within individual competences and the level of   suitability of work for the company.
";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"The formalised character of the preparation of students’ theses, which complete certain   stages of their academic education, covers incentives for engagement in this process both for them   and for academics who act as supervisors. Working on real problems defined by firms’ managers   make this process more attractive and offers several positive effects for all engaged actors. 
Knowledge generated as part of this process can be referred to as ‘thesis knowledge’ and flows both   ways between companies and universities. Academic knowledge is transferred from universities to   firms, while firms provide information to academics about current technological capacity and   preferred fields of implementable research. Students have an opportunity to gain work experience   and are more attractive to firms as employees than staff recruited in a more traditional way. They   can also develop a project realised in the form of a thesis which can be supported by the academic   knowledge of their supervisors and university laboratories.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Participation in the process   of student thesis creation could partly solve this problem and offers an opportunity to establish direct   personal relations between company managers and academics. Student theses prepared in co�operation with firms enable the accumulated potential of universities to be exploited. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Dependent variables are usefulness of thesis for the   enterprise, innovation level of proposed solution and possibility of its implementation. ;;;;;Independent variables used in the regression tree models are: type of students thesis, number   of students involved, type of university, supervisor's academic degree, previous experience of firm   with university and thesis writing initiative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"There was a statistically significant correlation (rho = 0.36; p < 0.05) between the degree of   employer satisfaction with cooperation with the university and the degree of achievement by the   university of benefits in the form of closer contacts with companies; the correlation was moderately   strong as evidenced by the rho <= 0.5; it was a positive correlation, which means that as the   satisfaction rating for cooperation increases, the benefit rating in the form of closer contacts with   companies increases. The hypothesis should be adopted only in this respect.
